package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the flash@@ card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of default modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed on your system , you may need more modules .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crashed , or the list of crashes , if any , er@@ ase .
the module View Filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar below Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory of different types .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ aries , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder reflects the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap image a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les is to be used ( and , therefore , display errors by restrictions in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in the search algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always kept . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
how split@@ ting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous to divide areas so that rectang@@ les arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can design@@ ate the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you view the picture gallery , a dialog box opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pictures per line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a slider and a box to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check box will show whether the file names will be displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the file size of the image to indicate whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
show the image size check box if the size of the pictures is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file sel@@ ector Save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
with the Sub@@ folder check box , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery .
with the check box &apos;s comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides you with easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you will find the media playback for the navigation area in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - View menu under Windows Navigation Pan@@ e or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser recognition add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change the browser recognition in one of the following options .
Chan@@ ges in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . you need , for example , M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes , are correctly represented with the identi@@ fier of this dep@@ rec@@ ated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ PT@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . all necessary information is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; here you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the edit ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the Develop@@ er mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you first start , you &apos;ll be asked where to store your images and database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter path names or click the Fol@@ der icon in order to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ pe Library . edit digi@@ kam create collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; needs recur@@ sively replace the library path in all its depth . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is a hidden folder . you can do this by setting a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ pe list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder symbol .
once you have configured the base folder , you can go to &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Tra@@ de@@ marks to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and raw work@@ flows .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ PT@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are used for data transmission using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , more distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras . it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is meanwhile obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , preview images may not be seen or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ tise is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal separ@@ ator line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put into keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is shown in the symbol view .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums may be sorted by the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date the album was first created , the date can be changed in the album &apos;s properties .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly in an album . you can also add im@@ porting images to the album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete albums after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Up Date .
the dum@@ my elder , average , New Year : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select &quot; Cho@@ ose &quot; in the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always only be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the My key@@ word list below in the main window . album collections have another effect . to the collection , always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided where you can re @-@ create preview images in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the previ@@ ew@@ ed preview . what information is this , you can edit settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help window , which appears when you leave the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window .
the image processing displays your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the right mouse button menu with the right button of the mouse and editing . in the editing section , you will find a guide how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu from opening . to this , and how to custom@@ ize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the thumb@@ nail and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you can keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or D@@ el If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ as@@ he@@ ets ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et below in the Date Vision , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
tags are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My word@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you add a new key@@ word , this will be the key@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and set out in the context menu As album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use keywords to use keywords , you first have to tag your photos with key@@ word . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos that you want to add with a key@@ word , you can drag them to the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word .
the photo is displayed when you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , it will be displayed in the main window by previ@@ ew@@ ing the image .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the drop @-@ down menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time@@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection box indicating the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp will turn red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for the search . for more information , see the Tools for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the contex@@ tual menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option can be added to this list by means of the search group / Search group . each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every image to find a similar picture . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the appropriate pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature Program . you can move or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window open . if you are back in the main window , you can quickly open the light table with L Tools illuminated table .
from the preview window you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the images , then they are also executed in the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of images . if you navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left . this simpli@@ fies to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the preview mode both images will display the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos capture , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , back , review , label , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provide information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc . note that you will have to switch to a larger drive sometime .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , working processes , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend saving the metadata option in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album Settings menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change something ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense since you can focus on the best photos with the further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or assign categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place . editing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want to let most of your photos just be seen , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after the landing . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historic period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer , to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as cap@@ tion . K@@ DE even makes a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time for the illustration and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving at the speed of light .
I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr , etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for cre@@ ators and authors ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the work identi@@ fier of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is an endor@@ sement of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright passages , although they offer no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify these , in the image , digital water@@ marks . for individuals this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs being lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section deals with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be careful and you can no longer be trusted than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive .
CD / DVD disks can become il@@ legi@@ ble , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but they write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive prot@@ ru@@ sion they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good capture device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the data back again to check you . likewise , don &apos;t forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then transfer to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read .
disc@@ maker keeps your statistics for you . your manufacturer &apos;s products include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy @-@ study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect such errors . some errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the imminent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
this can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a socket . remember that not every connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , please make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
because a voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should note that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
be aware of the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should think about stopping all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; lin@@ ux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open one day a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ efer@@ ences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of faults per year .
sun Micro@@ systems Z@@ FS seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a licensed GP@@ L license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; lin@@ ux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most think . it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; lin@@ ux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occ@@ ured , it is lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ xel and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said , a common reason for a data loss despite backup panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete assurance and the latest difference securing .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time where such a backup has been made . this f@@ use comes next to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that is only sc@@ anned and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machine . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync will only copy the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure lets you get enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each other th@@ inning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , maintaining memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
so virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and placed the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no more software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files .
D@@ NG Is developed because of the need to uni@@ fy the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already use D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon still use it sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; picture resource block quot ; technology of the &apos; 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include working on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera field , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
you can use external programs for fine @-@ gra@@ ined editing . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these may be cut off by other programs .
protect copy@@ rights with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section Add a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application &apos;s application will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the required selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , you can download the download button and download S@@ elected . the S@@ elected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you download all download or download the selected buttons , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , such as a normal folder . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete it all at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , you must select it first and then delete the selected delete selected .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of various recording settings to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been made in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder is automatically created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options to be done before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the default format , for example , in the edit field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y % d % H : % M : % M . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in capital letters , if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time of the recording to perform automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is used to automatically load sub@@ verb@@ s in the target album . all the images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sau@@ sage at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in longit@@ ude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ alists , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you forgot later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you have to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ o mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; lin@@ ux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the longit@@ ude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the prec@@ ur@@ sor of ha@@ iled coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give as much control over his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change in the Settings menu . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing can be started . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for publisher : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide that which offers the photo . this must not be the author if he is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; without being lost .
save image recei@@ pts as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse ho@@ ver rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code tries to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ code directory , which has none of these extensions , is ignored by &amp; digi@@ kam .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
setting P@@ NG compression allows you to reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , because P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and un@@ packing .
the TI@@ FF comp@@ ress option allows you to comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF @-@ images . it has no influence on image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works without loss .
if you select low @-@ loss JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard measure is that all green pix@@ els are the same . if you are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixel on odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed candles , as a continuous white . the setting colors will create some unusual results , as it shows the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pix@@ els generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the un@@ filled blue pix@@ els . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ invoicing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ invoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data , which come from the color filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pix@@ els . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was used .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ ding correction since you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like these should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a colour space in the other can be translated to the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior As@@ k if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examine this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your images are not managed on the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ ke@@ yst@@ one . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / c@@ p , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any denom@@ ination for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam , when you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also see &amp; edit the welcome screen display ; this speeds up the start process by &amp; digi@@ kam , under certain circumstances .
the setting When you look for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , prompt &amp; digi@@ kam ; you want it to delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ad / editing .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before saving file or saving the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Save button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving .
almost any image editing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rest@@ o@@ ints or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ connect .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , down picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the look menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically .
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the edit dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; change it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Picture menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . whole picture templates can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Printing Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; Main Window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows , also available in the image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same rider makes the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the bri@@ m .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be accomplished if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and gra@@ dations . it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select it and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ Field Ur@@ gency . the en@@ coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word display shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used previously .
the key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typ@@ ing keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection , if you want to add a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Date , key@@ word and searches . if in addition one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to tag you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is written on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created , and find that it should be one or the other , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want group@@ ing options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button Grupp@@ o . the options will then look like this :
why not listed Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ckr ? free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to those of your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should allow links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another colour space and think about color management ?
a visual example of the s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to record my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to knock out your monitor as s@@ RGB is that your ; on@@ itor to s@@ RGB is alli@@ bri@@ ated . if you are working as RGB colour space , then you must either set your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to process any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , balancing , automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection try to automatically make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
similarly , almost every brightness range has the same number of pix@@ els . sometimes the comparing very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ us of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited , since the color space is 8 bits per colour . if you are too far from the original image , you can perform over@@ exposure areas . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original look again , click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pix@@ els are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do this exactly . any setting of the white balance you set can store it in a text file and re@@ charge it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color t@@ apping can be done through the sub@@ window for the details . a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct coating problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect created when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting .
the intensity controls the solar installation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically feasible .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ starch / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three steps are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and watch how the image changes .
the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the image &apos;s settings , and the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : this selection box displays whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to modify the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the entry is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pix@@ els and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modify channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most useful . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will continue to help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the light tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pix@@ els are darker .
previ@@ ew@@ ing the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pix@@ els . if in more than one channel exposed pix@@ els are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer was edited and edited ; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu C@@ olo@@ urs @-@ Mixer of the image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and rash .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
controls for Red , Green and Construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance , the image will keep the overall brightness , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ th@@ est . far@@ brau@@ schen consists of small noise @-@ files that don &apos;t appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load it . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pix@@ els and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good with all the scenery images and fits especially well into portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .

use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly trans@@ lu@@ des the picture with a colored line , ni@@ p@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , ed@@ ged around with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool following aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any position . this is also possible at several points if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them .
every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool template you can lay a template on a picture .
the Image template menu App@@ ly in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil to the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the templates , a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates .
under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digital@@ ised images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras generally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
in JPEG images , a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to view correc@@ ting sharp@@ ness .
you should be careful with this since the results do not look very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ tw@@ ood and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect .
the radius represents how many pix@@ els are affected by the filter on each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for the edge of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ens and therefore plastic fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred image was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted det@@ aching filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing has usually achieved better results than bl@@ urred .
the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , meaning that the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ els removed far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse der Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is affected very strongly from the distant pix@@ els .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 , the image quality becomes very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further ag@@ grav@@ ate the image .
gauge the sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is wrong . in most cases , you should leave this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the die size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . however , note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but leave behind unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focuss@@ ed image :
the original unclear colour image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the field of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the G@@ lät@@ te controller sets the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values can mainly smooth out homo@@ geneous regions and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is required afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thing in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD , a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Artef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ ths &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor on all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is run . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient here .
angle @-@ gradually &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral cr@@ ot@@ ch distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pix@@ els . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel poli@@ shing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is low . however , it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to release it .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do this exactly . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it may take a long time to get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time by the Canc@@ el button .
the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can bl@@ ur the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the field of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or black@@ smi@@ thing occurs again .
edges : control edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ation tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more rou@@ gh@@ ened . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ it@@ ter cushi@@ oning . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ it@@ ter appear at the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ tw@@ ood and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s h@@ iss , movie gran@@ ul@@ arity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ acts Re@@ duce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a low @-@ loss compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and then re@@ charged .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old colour photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pix@@ els are a problem particularly in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pix@@ els .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ ot ; &amp; quot ; bright pixel @-@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pix@@ els .
load this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly to discover new hot or light pix@@ els by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and rel@@ o@@ ads it automatically at the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pix@@ els are raised in all thumb@@ nail areas .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to polish these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the adjacent pix@@ els is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pix@@ els in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pix@@ els that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pix@@ els in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pix@@ els with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pix@@ els in the block .
cubic : all pix@@ els with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic interface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pix@@ els in the block .
below you can see the pixel correction on a color photo , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise bl@@ ur effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ cleaner by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and with three more controls the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density filters . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the comp@@ act@@ ance correction on one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second grade deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correct . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the barrel or cushion distortion should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction then all first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would appear obvious to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal assistance line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . then , move the mouse cur@@ sor in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the cro@@ pping tool in the menu Transform@@ ieren Zu@@ cken from image editing or using the zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is re@@ achable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters setup and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO knob alters the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing movie particles on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X .
the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to be set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used equ@@ als ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ ths controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thes 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphas@@ ised . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . these would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equ@@ als 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 , the image is distorted in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using non @-@ shar@@ per effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ries the image along a star@@ shaped line that eman@@ ates from one center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by turning the pix@@ els around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ries the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image through horizontal movements of the pix@@ els . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft @-@ character@@ izing bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through random shifting of the pix@@ els and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur : finds the colour pool in the picture and bl@@ urs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ative Tur@@ ning and Transform@@ ating Sp@@ ying .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how you can infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can one inv@@ ent the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
changing the size of the tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pix@@ els . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the Ri@@ der New Size and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Kno@@ bs are used for this purpose . each plug @-@ in for photo can be saved as text file and then re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it may take a long time to get a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time by the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example of photo blowing by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ estimated operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ cked by pulling at the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle can be created by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the blank , use the button The blan@@ king button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; below in the dialog , you can set the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Max . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide help so that you can better compose your pictures . these aids are :
harmonic tri@@ angles : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more fluid char@@ ter@@ lines if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the golden spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos to your goal . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flux in this way .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spir@@ als . there should be something that the eye can be placed at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ al@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place a static object can be more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ontal Settings and Ver@@ tical View options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
slide your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . by pressing Pre@@ ferences , you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
for your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ieren Zu@@ cken from the image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally trim function . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a little bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called point of reference . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pix@@ els .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pix@@ els .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit sc@@ anned . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double such strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to trim the picture with transforming cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is bl@@ urred a bit . for a single loop this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings generating twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has some nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , edit &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in image processing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . you can find a more detailed description of these file formats in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful guides in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the &amp; digi@@ kam picture converter .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contained . hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and will generate preview for the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the module white balance .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft sign , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a consistent dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
split horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview range , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and disc@@ ard it on the part of the picture you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data stem from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature Program . you can move or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folder for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last paragraph can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character if another color follows . so if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are used free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . until now there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs .
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; cal@@ endar@@ s ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; )

loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting around 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ ene , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rem@@ o@@ ves opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; can also note your decision so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; set up , see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; instance ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
during the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come on a page , will be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph engraved on several pages with no head@@ line and with a different font
the Renew@@ al Store page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
open the page opens the ability to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can define a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked for each startup .
the context menu , which usually appears in a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ prepared graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for the generated graph@@ ene a jump spring model layout . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold @-@ he@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a multi@@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the Cir@@ co ; algorithm direc@@ ts the node circular to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ generated graphs ) .
if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of the changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net in which you draw the symbol .
a new icon creates a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
reco@@ vers the last re@@ trac@@ ted step . if you do not have made any progress , this function is de@@ activated .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match with those of the symbol pal@@ let .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the point you click on .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it displays the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialogue with the three pages templates for symbols , backgrounds and tool@@ bars .
with the add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the Tem@@ plates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pix@@ els or show a ruler and set a color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner display . you can also adjust the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Large , as well as the color 1 : and Color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images and provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source like Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
if you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values of duc@@ r@@ he . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scan button to view the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore generate very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots if you have selected in the menu impor@@ - &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have read the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay sufficiently high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialogue box appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
this module will archive your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b fuel program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for comfortable navigation . also , the Auto@@ Play option is available for Windows platforms .

Fli@@ ckr is an online photo management system . with Fli@@ ckr , it is possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos in the world , put photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the Fli@@ ckr user module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ckr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are led by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is therefore virtually your ID to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is started so that you can log on to Fli@@ ckr .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ckr website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed to Yes , you will see the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ckr for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access rights that the module displays . to upload , you need auth@@ oriz@@ ations . the module does not currently support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
this button lets you select the photos that you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ckr server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by com@@ ma . these are added to the image as key words during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options , you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos before up@@ loading are changed in size . size is taken from the value registered with maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the viewing dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera settings must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the maximum time devi@@ ation is set by an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a series of photos at the same place . since the dialog is aware of the coordinates of a call to the next one , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . to do so , select the relevant region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Take this repeatedly through until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a HTML page image to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will en@@ code UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side , you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have auth@@ oriz@@ ations . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab preview images allow you to custom@@ ize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lock to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mice . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a wind@@ owed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color information occurs . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG file format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invo@@ ke the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out Ex@@ i@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to launch the module .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as far as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start coding the movie with the coding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a note appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings button below .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is , for example , useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ ps better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now read@@ just the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently , or use them later otherwise , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has advanced .
this module can be used to convert all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the list of images and drop them down to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject .
pay attention not to send many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ Mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments on the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed .
the P@@ NG file format under the Menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted for loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and do not want to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend you JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files in JPEG format , the original exam data will be added to the images to be sent .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to have shown your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then ab@@ ort it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the left edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have annot@@ ated your images and videos with annot@@ ations , you can browse through these images , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , in other words , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annot@@ ated your images and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see image .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both people can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the ima@@ gery of your sphere of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use an &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the image below .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you have to select what image you want to see for each individual . to do this , you need to open the picture view window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your preferences and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog again on the image .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date for which to be searched ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture .
this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog box , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select Help the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing only 10 minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview preview ) and also the time line displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time line .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . the following part of the User Manual describes the in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can access via the HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , choose if an &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you will find more information on the export files in .
finally , you can select what information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is shown to the viewer without a description . note that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , it can scan your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL , where your site is stored .
best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . to allow the import function , see , properly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described here have all three based on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time doing this , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you don &apos;t have to do this job again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and import .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu File ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL that you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File ex@@ porting ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
to manually copy the .@@ k@@ im file to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . as most of the images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so anyway , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum frame size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pix@@ els high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ porting ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images should be copied .
it may be that you name the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pictured .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual are talked about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual the different settings are explained .
to the left , you will see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 button and clicking on the option you want .
it is described in how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the Di@@ alogue Options , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a group as explained .
in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ plug and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are used together with each other , it may be that the modules are tested with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that K@@ IP@@ I also use is that the other applications put their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order by albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with and k@@ photo@@ album ;
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply fits the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums .
when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people , for example , will do so , so if you would have selected people to the view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select in the modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you see the window that you can browse through your image database .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to annot@@ ate any image with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by assign@@ ing people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : if , for example , you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pictured , you can , by making the used names move up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected remarks for each image separately , you may still want to edit all selected pictures and annot@@ ate these images with annot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the pictures before and back , which are located below the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at a time with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window showing the US as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment panel it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the keys that form the frame &apos;s top edge . you can also make your own window from a frame by pulling it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... allowing you , among other things , to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window / hide . this process is shown in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you have set no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse down with the middle mouse button , and try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window open with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview window . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and select either the delete button or select the Edit menu item . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images , without you stored on the hard drive . of course you have to have the images stored somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that you can preview these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from folders and back into it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now , if you want to avoid fuss about how to mess up your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images .
in the Menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click on current view locking in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see and unlock the menu item everything except current view .
this allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to unlock , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to display the images again , click Lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with the ver@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours to describe is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer .
you can see the viewer in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information that you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser will show matching entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture icon high and image down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful viewer &apos;s ability to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can easily pull out a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse button . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the key button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work in videos that come in and zoom with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the picture using the script functions from the context menu . this does not work for videos . you can add comments to the current image using the menu point annot@@ ation from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set on the image . at the moment you can cancel and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to mark the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer allows you to view images with characteristics while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so if you print , print or whatever you have selected , simply add any notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply expressing the character of the character after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to exit the painting press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ model views is shown yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object that has already been selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the Edit menu bar or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene first .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can view the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when editing a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in landscape view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
objects are displayed relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another order , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below an existing view , drag the touch water to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , pull the ke@@ yer in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the touch on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the cham@@ ber@@ board .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ board . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are pending , you can anchor them in any position .
you can save the current window view with View Window order ... Save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 update . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering symbol in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene .
a render @-@ mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , it makes sense , but it is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop @-@ down sel@@ ector quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super sampling describes the adjacent pix@@ els . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pix@@ els exceeds the default threshold , a lat@@ ch of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pix@@ els is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pix@@ els , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel will then be transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialogue window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not support the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , import the source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag items from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . place the path to your document and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type plate .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the ground , a floor below the objects will be rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you activate edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page , you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section , you will see how to create and store window instructions .
the Standard window fitting : shows all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window alignment when starting the program .
the list of existing window classi@@ fications shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with diamond card you get a map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vers the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window fitting :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( bottom right ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the view of the camera here .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might insert a cube ( insert Finish body cube ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the plane , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the Pig@@ ment preview only shows a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ments . keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the Qu@@ ader and Sphere in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then press the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . in the coloring @-@ list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; object &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tree , select the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should already be able to perform this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the application button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the floor to one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click on App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection often result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ts is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer takes hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel on the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene , and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect pix@@ els .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a storage space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ t command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Rest@@ ric@@ ted .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
open a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tools tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return key .
you can set if any image is to be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is checked , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have a look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when you exit the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background with the selected color is also filled here .
you can set &amp; cu@@ ff show ; so set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
determines if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider / small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option lets you switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shrink the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing ; &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or wishes . this displays a dialogue with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate , it is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; try to give as much control over his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ shot ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ shot ; has a side bar at the right side , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; can@@ lite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save images .
&amp; Prin@@ ter ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer functions as images to scan and save images . &amp; can@@ lite ; can open a dialog for each image or store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; can@@ lite ; using the command mark@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialogue to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel and quit .
the other settings also contain more detailed driver options . &amp; can@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the full preview fits in the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog box of the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; can@@ lite ; store images . open dialogue to save for each image opens the dialogue before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sz@@ l@@ lite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default is your home directory , and you can change this by clicking the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is automatically added every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; chan@@ lite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over dialogue for &amp; can@@ lite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit .
&amp; can@@ lite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; can@@ lite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used like any other short@@ cut short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global short@@ cut keys by right @-@ click in the player window and set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands work . this allows you to make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all modules required are present and use a k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
the require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bark@@ ing v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the simplest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being generated . now , the script could write more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , cleaning up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expansion of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category of am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew !
normally you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script at compile time . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled for them to be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements section .
activating de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without any trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
when the player window displays , the player window will switch to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use m@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning ergometer .
more atmospheric : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , which changes the colour scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
voice files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the Settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save the playlist when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keeping the current piece visible during the piece change causes the play@@ lists window to be opened / un@@ rolled to keep the piece running in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is being picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; set by selecting Custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray described section will be activated . you can select type@@ faces for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . press select ... , you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
by selecting Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated among them for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start , that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the on @-@ screen display will enable you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors to custom@@ ize O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas will open the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can determine which screen of a multiple monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the Audio Output flash@@ card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this flash@@ card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting as with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched after music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) are added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is needed .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; on calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that the network port is entered under which the database is re@@ achable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
us@@ ername : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ ig@@ ns support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts call : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved to the played piece . note : you can see the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will provide trouble for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by typ@@ ing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , tag@@ li@@ b will crash when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of the libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , disable autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but they are not lab@@ eled as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easy to forget .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify the / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most plum@@ bing problems are resolved easily by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or for developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ ei@@ .net on the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if there is anything to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the surface , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras stat@@ s .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces you need to see the review column in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column to show review . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press En@@ f on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it down there just as you &apos;d like to do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look also for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar below Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is : what media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every only imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 de@@ co@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device needs to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously pass audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to specify a different sink ( e.g. sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you want a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . activate sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ D co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the quicker arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was highly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components and register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute drag @-@ register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report this at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before going to bed , then you are wo@@ ken up by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a functioning SS@@ H environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ p --@@ user your@@ us@@ ername am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ .
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right button mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the paste button after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control strip ?
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME lies on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
set the CD , then click audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score .
you can add the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as much as any other attributes , by selecting with the right mouse button on the piece and press F@@ 2 . you can edit the rating also in the Met@@ adata dialog .
developers do not want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that cannot be combined with the scheduled Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .

audio C@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information being played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free us@@ ername and password . audio C@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must recon@@ figure and install these output modules .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ installed , but the output modules are still not appearing . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and I use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up am@@ ok settings ... Audio output enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
you can use the plug @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check on sound card supported m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed car@@ er for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you don &apos;t like to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can immediately save the remaining matching entries . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and press the playback button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply right @-@ click on one entry and follow the burning menu . here you have several options to burn a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make the work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a playlist that is superior to anyone else . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers to capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or the current stream . one click on this area will change the display of the currently expi@@ red playing time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch via the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be shown in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also under the disk display . the PL knob activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pre @-@ settings .
to show the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context @-@ browser shows different information regarding the current piece . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information shown there are now divided into other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; also , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub @-@ window of music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to show cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context @-@ browser will also display covers images that are either embedded in the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded Parts , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played instantly .
among the stolen pieces are the favourite pieces from this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , click the right mouse button somewhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub @-@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com following the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below , a further division after the respective album is made . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ts .
group Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will .
the last button lets you change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , it might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . you will find information about using this filter in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box , which allows you to filter out the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select your entire collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
atta@@ ching to play@@ lists - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will enable you to play them next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - so the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm it , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear under different interpre@@ ters .
set up a compilation @-@ mark - Chan@@ ges a compilation selected as a compilation back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ts , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used to connect &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will load the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , quit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fet@@ ch music from an entered URL . for example , when you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ c.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping them . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : by this the dropped files are inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to play to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired position . once you enter characters , only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search words separated by spaces , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all keywords . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three .
if you enter the search term OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search gap , you may also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is searching for all the pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add , which you can add to the playlist .
next , follow the undo and restore buttons , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted to the analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example ren@@ ditions and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking double in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status Bar flag in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . you can access the settings of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k via this menu .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in your collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can select what to see in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the playlist . once you have set a piece to the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also add the pieces simply with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ specified ( details to set up these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add further random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio C@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select File . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old play@@ lists under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set mix and playlist mix instantly fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist received starts with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces are added at the next piece change , so your playlist is only filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point .
the New playlist emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .

played pieces - this is the number of pieces that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist according to each piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you select multiple play@@ lists , you will add &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; random items from each of the play@@ lists are added .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can adjust the settings by simply starting the script and then clicking on Con@@ figuration .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; install scripts by clicking on script . a selection dialog appears in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio en@@ coding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t W@@ MA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Y@@ ger : a feature @-@ rich auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . it can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the CD &apos;s basic folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog stores below is displayed to select folders and fil@@ en@@ ames for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called a file .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button firing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD @-@ project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is meant for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the media , it only blocks the previously imported files .
this allows you to create a copy of a CD that you can burn later on . alternatively , you can only copy a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
the DVD copying dialog allows you to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can burn later later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ one instead of normal copying . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which completely er@@ ases the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the firing button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button of the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ off video , en@@ coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and blocks of the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view also allows to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have a real function , it looks only pretty and separates the proj@@ ect@@ view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs , so system administrator privileges are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of your task is crucial in addition to which of the two programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void copy@@ c@@ d ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String equivalent ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String equivalent , Q@@ String parent ) void p@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String parent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quart@@ z ) void set@@ up@@ ware ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; read out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many en@@ coding using these WAV files ( compression ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . additional en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something by itself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not required , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about co@@ dec , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can circum@@ vent the protection , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; otherwise simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting @-@ up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily use of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , over which you stum@@ ble frequently in the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which co@@ dec programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , all of which is manually captured .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the en@@ coding settings tab in the Con@@ figuration menu - the en@@ coding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it is to be noted that before the en@@ coder was configured in the en@@ coder tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , picks ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; end ) .
open the main installation dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ file ; with different cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important , since both en@@ co@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play equipment is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . still needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression ratio about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Genu@@ ine for music from young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ K@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or by the program automatically retri@@ eved from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / needed with &amp; audio creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with en@@ coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the CD title to the key@@ word ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ file must be added ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of video creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ file ; is active to select a check box ( Send a address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with a different ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when fet@@ ching the data from the server ( but this can only know the program@@ mer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if you are using fre@@ ed@@ b , the nearest mirror server is to be used ge@@ ographi@@ cally . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirr@@ oring servers for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet .
for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be set on the tab for setting the en@@ coding . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer suite has to be installed from the Linux distribution , before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ dec . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and write per@@ missions on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ dec of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete hand@@ book , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine since it is regarded as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course always .
please make sure you have the / usr / share / cd directory and that you have scre@@ ams on it ( eg by trying to copy something in the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of audio @-@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them in each reading of a &amp; CD ; if the matching settings are found .
the device name is passed to the selection program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing device names for CD @-@ ROM and / or DVD drives helps .
the tab card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything is displayed in the same way as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only with incomplete information , please select , so that you will be notified when information on creating key words ( tags ) is missing .
the flash@@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to use the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls are running the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check out the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
set everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi systems . the resulting bit rate is approx . 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files to be codi@@ fying at the same time : in a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create an MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; copy of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , seek help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window bl@@ ended , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fet@@ ch the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the comment field below can be used for individual comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comments section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ coding or file formats . see Help for Ko@@ di@@ ver to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the resulting CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
when clicking on the selection button selection of the selection process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . this means reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration option to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of low performance machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order placed in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ dec of your choice .
as a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; audio creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different mapping maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading this ? even if only the help menu after the first start of the program was cli@@ cked , without any indication of how to go on from that somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; audio creator ; however , whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , it also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ Midi players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound Project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the item Play from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others both . some pieces do not have a text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . so if you select automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke lyrics will automatically be selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a certain type of event , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can sum@@ mar@@ ise . these are played out in series . in this section you &apos;ll see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click here to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then entering the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the sel@@ ections in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be stored . keep in mind that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection it needs to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add a song . it appears in turn , the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequences of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu item , or press the arrow to the right .
conver@@ sely a song to jump back , select the button Previous piece , the previous Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ ali@@ zations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . but the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices which are not general MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI &apos;s patches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order , nor om@@ it a line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds like a gun . to do this , add the following to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it will take Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the concept drum patch of the patch , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ boards for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are used above all to map out sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap first and second channel , make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch , all events will be ignored that attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pres@@ umes that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , just open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select Settings under the Point se@@ wer view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the single instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
first , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop when the collection is finished or I want to play a file , just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off Automati@@ cally Add to Collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the settings Automatic Add to Collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play out B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; LA@@ GA ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; LA@@ GA . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ va @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list under friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to point out that I only want to re@@ program because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Wit@@ ta , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ va / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , look for information and view pictures . you also find links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if you encounter problems , please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you are looking for an entry , your group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the playlist &apos;s menu and either select the processor mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the processor mode is abandoned or another group is selected without the same playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / Rem@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can thus end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / M@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer is visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like the setting up of the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special em@@ bed field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE are given .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the started process is called kn@@ pp@@ layer . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always take a given back end for a certain Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . the code to be used should be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained therein .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ resource , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source .
is there any hint on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as root after entering the device . it is essential to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is used to compile &amp; to@@ ggle ; requires .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be resor@@ ted to the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the box should be established .
if you have any questions , or if you want to compile them , add them to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its options should be consul@@ ted the hand@@ book to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Con@@ figuration Assistant by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document .
document classes : this document contains the type of document that is to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ att@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ all &#93; , project projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
en@@ coding : this is used to set the character en@@ coding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 en@@ coding as a standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ in packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they need to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command will be created ( e.g. , \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ gin@@ ally the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex file . once a DVI file is created , click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the search query , the elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as one element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is spec@@ kled in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no source code errors ) .
watch surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is displayed on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , after the fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection boxes were developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for the quick structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , gro@@ o@@ ves or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , image or other element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection over a selection field possible ) .
when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ ke is used for setting the font size . it can be set the fon@@ ts for the main text , gro@@ o@@ ves , etc .
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the files according to the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above sample source sample has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Build or the Quick Construction button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; C@@ le ; execute the storage automatically .
if the document fails , it should be searched in accordance with the errors . when using Quick Construction &amp; Occ@@ ult , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size .
changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many ways to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now followed for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ;
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c expression and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( d . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file printing ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been created , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only modern under Settings box must be set up ... tools to be selected .
in order to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward looking . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer happens then .
with this function in &amp; Occ@@ ult ; with a single click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and bound to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; O@@ epi@@ ece , as text editor ( Settings ...
should an error occur while using the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can then use the Previous La@@ Te@@ X Error and Next La@@ Te@@ X errors for brit@@ tl@@ eness . to view the fla@@ wed line , you must click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the error line .
once the button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting a document , a document can either be re @-@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created .
when creating a new document using a file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General can be set .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this manner , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default size .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if an easy way to create a template is being searched , one should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability to read and extract from many different types of text files ( including &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Po@@ sters ; can be made directly from &amp; boxes in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; which means that by clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using arrow keys with pressed shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can insert additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entry points or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump . this also highlights this jumping brand , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options have been added into &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; always ren@@ ders many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Ex@@ cep@@ tions , the following commands are included for text selection :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . with one paragraph there is not a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back guard ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to solve a part of the document , it can be selected at first and removed by pressing the button de@@ f . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the button root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ o@@ ving , the following commands are included to resolve the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands in the editing environment for one possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many remote ambient commands , the above @-@ mentioned environment can be lost quickly . this command fills the most recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the ground opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the ground closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted trun@@ cated groups @-@ brackets , the above @-@ mentioned group can be lost quickly . this command fills the most recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as standard . for the practical implementation is used in &amp; boxes ; the sign is used for two simple quotation marks . also for the end of the execution the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two closing instructions for &amp; lat@@ ex ; a .
this automatic set @-@ up of double entr@@ y@@ ways can set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Let La@@ Te@@ X turn on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. , german or French ) , as well as German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when selecting Shift , paste button &amp; kick ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located inside a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line breaks but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close &amp; to@@ ggle ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line breaks .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to order the columns in tables and environments and thereby assign all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already providing a good source code completion , this has been extended into &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the back button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list is displayed . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing poin@@ ter marks Next , and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . you can select different set lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few characters with \ \ begin to be entered and a large list of environment commands is required . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; boxes ; a special mode for the completion of environments is available .
when calling the complete environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically filed and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient perf@@ ecting can be continued in the simplest way and stopped by pressing the input button .
once this has been done , the environment will be closed automatically . once and box ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be logged with .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the top list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of pick@@ ups that can be replaced immediately by bet@@ ting strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word perf@@ ected over the Men@@ Ã ¼ &quot; Edi@@ ting Proced@@ ure or the Key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large number of che@@ eks are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many changes in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all previously written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... le Finish can be switched off . here , the threshold value can also be specified for the display of completion .
the completion files can be installed in the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / / Per@@ s@@ â s Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics are simple and simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections and sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is specified , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ wise in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating Imple@@ mentation and Cre@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ - 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed by means of old ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed by means of old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Construction command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be added to the project Neues Projekt .... By this , the following information for the project is qu@@ eri@@ ed :
when running the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ti@@ lep@@ tin project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; boxes ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ established system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents , including documentation for the pack@@ ets contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for the search for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into two important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ tu@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working surface environment ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , enabling &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
thank you very much for those who want to continue the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with regard to the &amp; GNU ; license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber &amp; Ki@@ le ;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures are edited in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig . with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is used for all day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signature you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this allows you to receive an empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; and add your signature in the lower section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programmes such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the Red Cross Rem@@ oval in the tool@@ bar .
open the short commands dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user &apos;s button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ b ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stac@@ king input is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .

the Version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and ready !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the dist@@ ressed working folder , then leave the current working folder listed . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already stated , everyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the open file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book then just let the current work folder be selected . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked already has been selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick on current file and select the file to be reviewed by means of a different file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection for both the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the sel@@ ector current file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality at once and don &apos;t have to wait until somebody uses the plug in &amp; GUI ; more about it can be found below .
in order to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the menu Plugins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plug @-@ ins contained and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other in a project . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and press the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S once it is added to the project , etc ;
on the Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such lad@@ ders are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note input is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the annot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax @ annot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ annot@@ ation ( role ) will play a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta Settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including code completion , it can be changed . entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ump@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the tags are inserted this way as they are described in the tags XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
upper / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : upper / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal cap@@ itali@@ zation means that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is inserted for tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and finish day automatically : when switched on , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa .
automatically replace acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for detection of different types of files . using the default button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / hanging from views . it comp@@ lies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of warnings by hook of no more requests .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser knots in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the click of a mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of node in the tree , the updating properties of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , divided . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ h abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plu@@ gins are K@@ Part applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ compliant application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
enter : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is checked , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely new . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the Deb@@ u@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ ggers . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen Session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a Deb@@ u@@ g request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be shown in the Deb@@ u@@ gger issue .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution continues . if a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a request has been requested , the execution begins once a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include in error .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and move to the next as if there was not the current one .
open a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog lets you enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , easy @-@ to @-@ use &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , open &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic boxes of image buttons ( above the edit pane ) , the text and instructions can be inserted faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog , which &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without risk of a writer .
tag Fol@@ der contains only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a single element of itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
valid only for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
set a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used once for any attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies source code for attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tags % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg rup@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is set up in the above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the open descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = default 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set up with Settings ... set . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are sub@@ stituted with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
select text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed accordingly . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , on the default output . it can be indicated what should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in given cases , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable dialogue &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start date , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly dismissed , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user should be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... set actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialog tool@@ bar dialog . make sure the tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like , for example , a quick way to access Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , repository , if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tags .
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources can be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that they are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to send with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others can download them . entries are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a single contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for what it takes a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when you upload , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose a key .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool@@ bars tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be needed . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and convert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions Line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you first have to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the divi@@ ders with info and the tool@@ bar . please check in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all the parent , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting , or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; in your document , then click on the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate them , open them and wander through . in the presentation with a share holder are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available script languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . more functions are available via the right mouse button , such as starting , editing , or em@@ ailing the script .
this view displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh the tree .
this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the entry system geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two par@@ lo@@ aders at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the news window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can backup them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ dable mark@@ up language editor would make it ? well , this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what already someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ er Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML , when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
editing and switching the problem report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphic files to your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . actions must be added using Settings ... Edit tool bars are saved through tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you &apos;ll be asked when asking if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be re@@ plen@@ ished without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu of the tags / actions on this tool@@ bar in the tags menu .
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion using tool@@ bar is denied when this day is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the kate ; version .
choose the type of line ID . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that matches the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting a job will activate the appropriate sub@@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect every application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , one finds details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can add and change sequences .
this should generate a help in line with the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ eu ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host configuration , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
ask if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can select a precise selection of man@@ ure .
this shows a list of the files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook @-@ up or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
event configuration can be done in the event configuration window and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a particular event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are also active , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten with program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk drive option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are written in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to distinguish tool bars from the menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is handled in the section Ad@@ ding tool bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a New tool@@ bar can be removed , tool bar can be renamed , tool bar can be renamed , or tool@@ bars can be set , which can be specified , which actions should be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action will be displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings tool bars ... and set actions to set actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions one imag@@ ines for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions indicated at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are written in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document should be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plates tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As a Local Tem@@ plate .
once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree below project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert files or associate with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things in using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set a folder &apos;s behavior in the template index , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded once the parent attributes are inherited .
in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like a text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be in a root folder .
allows prior or post@@ script text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right button of the mouse ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be re@@ achable via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor if necessary , in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit , continues to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is running synchron@@ ously . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the push button moves the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , keeping the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a single click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow .
the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . this can be done with the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of looking for pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sors is possible as in word processing , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way using tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding anch@@ ors tag .
some tool@@ bars like the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file names with a relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire match with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP that contains the template template .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that did a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge a complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when mer@@ ging a folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and comp@@ lies with the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make typ@@ ing easier by typ@@ ing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
standard Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 folder Car@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder Car@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows to manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialogue re@@ members your selection and shows it next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the matching or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to set an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag the text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the thought behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort .
note : at the moment , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and placing of text into another program as cut and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while above the line .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Chang@@ ing &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to find the resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump to the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual processing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the source file ; this is only a substitute for the case that you change your mind and possibly yet again select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options Num@@ bers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , side up , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , see how you are used by other programs .
in the File Window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / final distinction , to the next / previous distinction ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if enabled , it will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option because you could inad@@ vert@@ ently over@@ write the cli@@ p@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be framed . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically displays an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the incoming line ind@@ entation will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is om@@ itted then .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line supply &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line character , although they are different . if this option is checked , they will be disabled as a white sign . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slow with very large files .
this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is ski@@ pped .
this is useful when white notes are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking for details .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries .
in the selection fields for the en@@ coding a brief reference appears , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ ational character . )
custom@@ ize the file en@@ coding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the en@@ coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit un@@ ic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can define the en@@ coding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; gt ; C will appear next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the information you need .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply skip the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only in the line interval . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff . but for this an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient .

while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre@@ processing command for line compar@@ isons . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , some details are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for display and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases , when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , a small news window informs you of the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that were compared to that time are listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically chosen . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and when the option folders are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical .
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
when two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merge ( unsure ) then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , the error message appears . if such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folder cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging one file is executed after the other . you status column indicates Fer@@ tig when the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C is used as a destination in the three @-@ file merge mode , B is chosen as the target and the A and / or B will be used as a destination when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries may be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry : select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options passing , Sim@@ ulate , and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute certain actions with all entries . if manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select the directory merge and continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , then a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if you encounter a bug , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , it notes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them later . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate samples can be entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a pre@@ defined poin@@ ter marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
in the case of links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
with links to folders : when the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not result in possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
the files are considered to be the same if they are the same size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modified date has been lost . please use caution . this option switches off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the more recent file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed the knowledge that the other file has not been changed . you should check it in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal compilation of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view will remain visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn the option directory &amp; text windows to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text windows .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking it . however , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge .
but this status is lost if you read the directory again : list -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is always assumed to be a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to process permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date differ from the original . ( note the option of Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of Size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P starts first ever the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to recover the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; run as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the program@@ mers who have gone this way or will let him go that way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will not be treated iden@@ tically . if similar lines are next to each other , this is the most often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort required to do this has been too big so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system installed in the K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .

cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift removal ) paste into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) paste the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replace the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder during mer@@ ging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already include these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . far@@ ew@@ ells in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) will be treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the blank background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if , however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
when this field is enabled , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual work@@ spaces .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ tops . if it is enabled together with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally allows &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and shift the windows as symbols or with its contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch @-@ switches ... lets the dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login as root user or turn to your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete guide for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a drop @-@ down window .
in the default setting , it increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the drop@@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier icon . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
in addition , when you press the Shift key or Shift &amp; M@@ b ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ id ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to later insert it into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop the display refresh . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; K@@ id ; automatically uses your set @-@ up short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc ; .
it is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can magni@@ fier ; to make use of a screen area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor has stayed in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and cause pain in every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor has stayed in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer pain on the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can use the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may cause pain .
to clarify this : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain caused by clicking with the mouse is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
the smart shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button .
this residence time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click navig@@ ates .
if the mouse is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button again , when no moving takes place in the meantime .
this function is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Gener@@ el General . there &apos;s a slider set of sound buff@@ ers that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s last press .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first of all with the default settings . in particular , the smart shifting should be turned off at first . if you then get used to the automatic click of the mouse , you can later take the smart move away .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a move has just begun . if you use the smart shifting in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor in where you want it . but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to perform a keyboard input . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart shift is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to mark text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , use the mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button cle@@ ars a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shift time begins when smart shifting . later , you can use the smart shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button for a short while . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to stu@@ n the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a drag action begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that mu@@ te users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course pro@@ positions that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command , which will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book script . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages from the text passages , without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary of the word addition . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory storage of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have arrived correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can choose the sentences that are to be spoken again .
set up Settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter Supp@@ lements and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character en@@ coding , with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
kt@@ ts@@ d language service is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage book menu or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Booking , the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the input memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box to close the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text@@ book script should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ book script will not be saved . select Before saving , it will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passage record is to be saved .
the word supplement page contains a list of dictionary entries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field , there is a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary .
using the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , modify the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language in the drop @-@ down box to set the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the word list . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to only insert properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by choosing the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new post or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with notices about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably don &apos;t have the command to set the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows Free@@ T@@ TS to be used for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ aks folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended sample for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the lyrics in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; .@@ r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wider voice service that provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to set up , use the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ TT@@ SD Language Service &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , to let text be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases can be saved , which the user can always rel@@ inqu@@ ish .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text through the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; node ; applications .
speech output is provided by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the generation of language output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application with no visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor and makes ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ related mailing list . you can also read the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ se@@ . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ file ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and adjust program speech di@@ sti@@ ckers . see also :
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card speakers will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the General tab is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
if you click on the Kar@@ tei@@ tab speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the Kar@@ tei@@ karte guide will be displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet another speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speaker appears in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a nar@@ rator from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of the mouse , select a nar@@ rator from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of the mouse , select a nar@@ rator from the list , and click on this button to push the nar@@ rator in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the kar@@ ab@@ card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use it to read text .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab General to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succ@@ eeds , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the selection , the K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the language output box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system field of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can pre @-@ read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for pre @-@ reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the tab card is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab General and tick the language output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that is to be read , and select tools in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible brands are also read out .
in &amp; Promoti@@ ons ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the displayed text . then check the text that is to be read , and select tools in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you about events you set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ats .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can notify you when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace incor@@ rectly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid specific defects of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the ongoing orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the space . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you get from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for issuing longer texts , which don &apos;t have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined strings of strings that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with speech selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speakers , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or an &amp; k@@ de ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all activated filters installed on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters installed . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the setup of strings of strings . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the matching substitute text .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages when you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string translation filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply when equal . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string representation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited to both sides by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the voice selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker set up on the kar@@ ab@@ card speaker or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by a female voice from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text attached to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker attributes that present the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker set up on the Kar@@ tei@@ karte guide . with the speech selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression set . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in the input .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which is most likely to meet the desired requirements . click the right button to view the dialog of Spe@@ aker S@@ election .
use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings , or delete all settings .
the speech selection filter only applies to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API of &amp; k@@ de ; for full documentation for both AP@@ Is you will find on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for Festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H can be found .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gib@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character en@@ coding option is set to the correct language value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a string translation filter . see .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license you find in their respective documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code of k@@ de@@ file under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS works with each speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages at rate . also consult the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the speech &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to extend it for use of any other synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , compile , need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you are using the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ files or downloaded each night currently created tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech discs is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can return sentence or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can indicate the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add on the Kar@@ tei@@ card Add @-@ in , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Poster Set Box setup is shown below . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the character en@@ coding for text that is passed to the festival . when votes are known , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the chosen voice will not allow you to change these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first movement is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click on App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise after startup only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr can be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are performed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely edited proposition .
using the buttons in this row , you can proceed to or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of multiple sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will shrink to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the audio card . see also .
only text orders are performed and managed here . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or respect@@ fully compiled without support for the appropriate audio module ; it is not possible to load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ GB ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ мм ; % about double normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can go to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output queu@@ es in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played prior to the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and output of screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; pre @-@ read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ erts .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends out if someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of cards as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . the last option is to carry out the action specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( All other Events can &apos;t be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fication are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently it supports and kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival uses the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 5 ; % , SS@@ ml lyrics are usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and set limits filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds teach text into individual sentences . this allows you to start typ@@ ing faster , because only the first proposition must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set limits detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit filter filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other set limits filter filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set the subscri@@ ber sel@@ ector by simply trying out . switch off the speech selection and select text for pre @-@ reading . switch back the speech selection , change some features and check the selection of the speaker . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the default string detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) . note that the default set limit filter preserves the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal set limits filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the Kar@@ tei@@ card Spe@@ aker S@@ election . the flash@@ card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker with all the features of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the original set @-@ up properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place multiple markings .
since language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is , if you know that a specific application is text in another language than the one set in the working environment .
in order to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker range , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use the Spo@@ kes@@ person closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is in the queue for the last word order . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes when it &apos;s started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you must register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; kon@@ sole ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / soli@@ di@@ al@@ int / vocals , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Synthes@@ i@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the kar@@ ab@@ card for subscri@@ ber unit . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ml . ) de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ml Um@@ form@@ er@@ Filter , and set the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokesperson , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file converts to convert from SS@@ ml to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a special string translation filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ am ; no more rules to proceed or go back . on the tab orders is shown , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you can &apos;t filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for set limits detection instead .

some users are involved in audio output related to AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . it freezes when you stop a text order and then start another .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ en does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but otherwise it is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; lin@@ ux ; CDs already included .
if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( tar gri@@ pped archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian Distribution guidelines ) .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination .
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs compiled from the sources .
cd k@@ de@@ vic@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ e@@ fi@@ le.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use it , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . you &apos;ll find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to input the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R for example .
festival is usually included in the &amp; lin@@ ux market distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the en@@ coding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon Files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German texts Di@@ phones .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder Festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS English Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package that you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the inser@@ tion of the error correction is not required , you just need to re @-@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer that can be controlled in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; on the command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this guide explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; ..
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; Start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device actually shows and allows the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are being installed and installed on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the option to select the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . by marking the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can be viewed only , changing the settings is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... arranged in the device dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options .
the automatic mode allows TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the option Man@@ ually , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be set . in the IP address field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . if in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn on an off @-@ switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which connects the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ net networks .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain information by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will release this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ranked in priority by selecting a job and exec@@ uting or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Buttons Up or Her@@ down .
by clicking the Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of known computers contains host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNA servers .
usually , the list of registered computers contains some entries , the loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the familiar computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the alias names .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ known Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de will not suff@@ ice , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second chapter , all of the configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace previous knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conve@@ yed .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to go through in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point which holds a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be arbitr@@ arily selected !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a particular area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses in the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes also dynamically altered for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is refer@@ enced by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which in addition offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was answering a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be embedded in &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ ls the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . notice &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the credits on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects and k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by folding the entry .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; exists by changing the symbol for the band to realize that the integration for the band has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use data to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process must be format@@ ted before you can format your tape before using it . flo@@ ppy drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the testing process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your choice once again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the tape . this process er@@ ases all existing index files for this volume . you can re@@ construct the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are stored , such as the folder . folders mounted on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be separately registered under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then will be backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ boot version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , tran@@ sm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the spin at the tape drive . this setting may not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , you will automatically disc@@ ard the tape when solving &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the remaining files on the tape are tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide fast access to information about problems appearing on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides users with fast access to information about problems appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - to open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead of it a small news window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or after entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the process column , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar ; this will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are indicated with a more prominent color than the protocol lines of the step hint . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off settings dialog .
if you only want to show certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window contex@@ tual menu to allow all new protocol lines to be displayed .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system quickly becomes the standard for the control of program start @-@ up when bo@@ oting the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and reform@@ at@@ ting . Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an In@@ it file . therefore , you must be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you will be able to repair it by re@@ starting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user run level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when they pull out an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the serial number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sort number or name of an entry , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ very ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check that all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrect .
the meaning of the &amp; lin@@ ux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adju@@ st@@ ment by &amp; k@@ user ; Read More .
after you made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a flash@@ card will be created on which you can set individual settings . additional flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD uni@@ forms .
the password management tab appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD uni@@ forms .
this card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations each in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
the tab group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large box .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and alter the boot password , change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
