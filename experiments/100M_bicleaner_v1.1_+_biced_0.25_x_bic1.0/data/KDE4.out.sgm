<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Website. from the drop-down list select the starting and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations don't make any important decisions depending on the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual to & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the flashcard tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default modules from the kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed on your system, you may need more modules.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; crashed, or the list of crashes, if any, erase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View Filter (also called Folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar below Extras address filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's up-to-date working directory of different types.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentaries, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder reflects the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap image a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and, therefore, display errors by restrictions in the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the search algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; this target is not always kept. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous to divide areas so that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you view the picture gallery, a dialog box opens, allowing you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "option allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "the option" "" "Pictures per line" "" "has a slider and a box to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the" "" "File Name" "" "check box will show whether the file names will be displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Check the file size of the image to indicate whether the file size is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Show the image size check box if the size of the pictures is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selector Save in HTML file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the Subfolder check box, you can set the subfolder to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the check box's comment file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides you with easy access to general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You will find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; - View menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition add a menu entry in & konqueror, where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. you need, for example, MSIE browser recognition to call up with the & konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Elements and attributes, are correctly represented with the identifier of this deprecated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check menu under Extras Website. you can make the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; document the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors will be displayed. with this review, you can make sure that your pages are correctly represented by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style templates embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site to further instructions and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the server for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; -style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web-archive for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in the .pdf format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Use the mouse to archive your website and it appears a dialog to save the displayed website.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module web archive is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik sipbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gPT2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, review and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. all necessary information is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list by & digikam; here you can ask questions to other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the edit; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the Developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you'll be asked where to store your images and database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter path names or click the Folder icon in order to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use as an Alpe Library. edit digikam create collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images as a base folder. & digikam; view each subfolder as an album. no image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; needs recursively replace the library path in all its depth. you can't exclude any subfolders unless it is a hidden folder. you can do this by setting a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Alpe list have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder symbol.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can go to & digikam; set up your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Trademarks to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and raw workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gPT2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are used for data transmission using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, more distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras. it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is meanwhile obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, preview images may not be seen or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to digitise is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal separator line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put into keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this is shown in the symbol view.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums may be sorted by the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date the album was first created, the date can be changed in the album's properties.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly in an album. you can also add importing images to the album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete albums after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Up Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The dummy elder, average, New Year: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select "Choose" in the contextual menu & quot; As album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always only be included in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list below in the main window. album collections have another effect. to the collection, always include all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait briefly while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided where you can re-create preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the previewed preview. what information is this, you can edit settings; set up the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window, which appears when you leave the mouse-cursor a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">The image processing displays your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements to these. you can reach all the functions that come with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the right mouse button menu with the right button of the mouse and editing. in the editing section, you will find a guide how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality that you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu from opening. to this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the thumbnail and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you can keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 image deleting or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Entf.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datasheets; organizes your photos according to the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the Date Vision, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My wordlipiquot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My stitch quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and set out in the context menu As album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use keywords to use keywords, you first have to tag your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos that you want to add with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">The photo is displayed when you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, it will be displayed in the main window by previewing the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the drop-down menu. the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timedependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved via this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box indicating the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp will turn red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. here you can find more rules for the search. for more information, see the Tools for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. any option can be added to this list by means of the search group / Search group. each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or at least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every image to find a similar picture. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the appropriate pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Miniature Program. you can move or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to drag a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The light table add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window open. if you are back in the main window, you can quickly open the light table with L Tools illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview window you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you synchronize from the toolbar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the images, then they are also executed in the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of images. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left. this simplifies to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal soldering actions also work directly from the light table, such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click on it and hold the & LMB; hold down. in the preview mode both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just as in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos capture, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, back, review, label, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provide information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam; if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use not & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc. note that you will have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos then you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata option in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change something? to do so, & digikam, provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign any photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense since you can focus on the best photos with the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or assign categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place. editing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords will be edited by & digikam; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlapped. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to let most of your photos just be seen, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historic period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer, to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as caption. KDE even makes a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time for the illustration and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving at the speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical indications. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr, etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and authors): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the work identifier of the photographer. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is an endorsement of the author's field, this must also be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright passages, although they offer no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify these, in the image, digital watermarks. for individuals this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, loss of disk, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spreading superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs being lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. this section deals with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be careful and you can no longer be trusted than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can become illegible, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but they write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protrusion they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good capture device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. then read the data back again to check you. likewise, don't forget to copy the media with a description, date & author and then transfer to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discmaker keeps your statistics for you. your manufacturer's products include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: floppy-study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART can not detect such errors. some errors detected by SMART indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">This can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a socket. remember that not every connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, please make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because a voltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should note that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Be aware of the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV you can get for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should think about stopping all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you open one day a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate intereferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of faults per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">Sun Microsystems ZFS seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a licensed GPL license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most think. it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common filesystems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occured, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">"" "" "" "viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss." ""</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixel and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterprevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said, a common reason for a data loss despite backup panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance. creates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete assurance and the latest difference securing.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time where such a backup has been made. this fuse comes next to a versioning system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machine. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync will only copy the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you get enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each other thinning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC information, associated XMP files, maintaining memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">For valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the time span you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate during time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">So virtualization is available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and placed the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # Source, the new disk is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc # source;</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if there is no more software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG may store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Is developed because of the need to unify the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already use DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon still use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe's XML-based XMP technology has introduced to replace the & quot; picture resource block quot; technology of the '90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera field, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine-grained editing. if you edit the pictures again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these may be cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect copyrights with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section Add a photos to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your legacy database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application's application will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the required selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, you can download the download button and download Selected. the Selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been edited by & digikam. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, of course, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you download all download or download the selected buttons, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums, such as a normal folder. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete it all at once by using the Delete All Delete button. if you want to delete only a few, you must select it first and then delete the selected delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digitized; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames, if you upload photos of various recording settings to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been made in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this last option, a folder is automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options to be done before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, for example, in the edit field, you can use the prefix photo-% Y% d% H:% M:% M. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in capital letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digikam, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time of the recording to perform automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available, & digikam; this is used to automatically load subverbs in the target album. all the images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case saves & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the option Date-based sausage at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digikam; you know where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmentalists, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you have to store this data in the gpx format, as this is the only format that is supported by the geo mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing can be started. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for publisher: this field should include the professional name of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to provide that which offers the photo. this must not be the author if he is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digicode database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam; without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image receipts as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse hover rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>

<seg id="293">Some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are set here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-subsampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Setting PNG compression allows you to reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF compress option allows you to compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it has no influence on image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works without loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">If you select low-loss JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard measure is that all green pixels are the same. if you are sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixel on odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard, it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps get more details in top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed candles, as a continuous white. the setting colors will create some unusual results, as it shows the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the unfilled blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosainvoicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosainvoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data, which come from the color filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was used.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for grading correction since you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like these should be given. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from a colour space in the other can be translated to the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam; examine this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the opportunity & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your images are not managed on the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include color mapping or gammakeystone. currently, dcraw gamma isn't corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate on how your image would be given by a device. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / cp, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any denomination for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the trash bin, you can adjust the conversation of & digikam; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digikam, when you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without reviewing. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see & edit the welcome screen display; this speeds up the start process by & digikam, under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When you look for new photos compels & digikam; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something has been deleted from the base folder, prompt & digikam; you want it to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be in & digikam; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ad / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before saving file or saving the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should, therefore, make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Save button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any image editing action can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Restoints or Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to reconnect.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; press the button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down picture or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the look menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you get to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the edit dialog by & digikam; change it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Picture menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. whole picture templates can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Printing Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Das & digikam; Main Window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation arrows, also available in the image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider makes the sidebar appear and disappear into the brim.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be accomplished if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and gradations. it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select it and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC-Field Urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword display shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used previously.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typing keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection, if you want to add a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Date, keyword and searches. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to tag you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is written on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and find that it should be one or the other, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want grouping options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button Gruppo. the options will then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why not listed Picasaweb or Flickr? free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed choices at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should allow links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another colour space and think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to record my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to knock out your monitor as sRGB is that your; onitor to sRGB is allibriated. if you are working as RGB colour space, then you must either set your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to process any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, balancing, automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction try to automatically make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similarly, almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes the comparing very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jius of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited, since the color space is 8 bits per colour. if you are too far from the original image, you can perform overexposure areas. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original look again, click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do this exactly. any setting of the white balance you set can store it in a text file and recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tapping can be done through the subwindow for the details. a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct coating problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect created when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar installation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically feasible.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquire; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminance of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchstarch / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three steps are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The preview will be updated dynamically, based on the image's settings, and the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box displays whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle notes, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to modify the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the entry is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is usually the most useful. in this case, the logarithmic mode will continue to help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the light tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Previewing the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer was edited and edited; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colours-Mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and rash.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for Red, Green and Construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep luminance, the image will keep the overall brightness, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the farthest. farbrauschen consists of small noise-files that don't appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load it. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option over exposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image can be seen under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good with all the scenery images and fits especially well into portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepian: produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a little coldness in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiate. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Use the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly transludes the picture with a colored line, nipce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), edged around with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool following aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any position. this is also possible at several points if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; apply tool template you can lay a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu Apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil to the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the templates, a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the stencil. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image below. it is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you must resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK, if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras generally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera is often applied to internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to view correcting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this since the results do not look very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Conducting softwood and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for the edge of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpens and therefore plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">The original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred image was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocussing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted detaching filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing has usually achieved better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauss's folding has a very long tail, meaning that the mathematical result also depends on the source pixels removed far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse der Gauß's folding is affected very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0, the image quality becomes very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further aggravate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge the sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge. use this parameter if your blur is wrong. in most cases, you should leave this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the die size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. however, note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but leave behind unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the field of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Glätte controller sets the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothing over the image. whereas larger values can mainly smooth out homogeneous regions and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details in such a way that no sharpening is required afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothing in one direction. if you have a movie granulator or CCD, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooths [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor on all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is run. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-gradually [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral crotch distance [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel polishing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is low. however, it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do this exactly. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a long time to get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time by the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the field of sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or blacksmithing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: control edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamation tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more roughened. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter cushioning. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use this tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Conducting softwood and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's hiss, movie granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or later digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts Reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a low-loss compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and then recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old colour photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image can be seen under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Das & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelot; & quot; bright pixel-quot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you capture the dark image directly to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and reloads it automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all thumbnail areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then, select the best filter method to polish these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic interface (2 dim) or a group of cubical curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the pixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting Correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centercleaner by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and with three more controls the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density filters. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine readjustment of exposure of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the dation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the compactance correction on one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grade corrects the removed corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the edges as in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the inverted sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correct. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The barrel or cushion distortion should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction then all first. if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would appear obvious to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal assistance line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines. then, move the mouse cursor in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove this with the cropping tool in the menu Transformieren Zucken from image editing or using the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image can be seen under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website that is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters setup and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO knob alters the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam filter is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing movie particles on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X.</seg>
<seg id="596">The cinematic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy view specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to be set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used equals ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smooths controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothes 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasised. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon recording filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equals 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses proprietary algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look like it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time by the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using non-sharper effects. it uses proprietary algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurries the image along a starshaped line that emanates from one center. this simulates the blur a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurries the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurs the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft-characterizing blur: blurs the image soft in the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking sharpness: wipes the image through random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blur: finds the colour pool in the picture and blurs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a protected algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of droplets on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should stay free.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. you can find the tools in the menu Transformative Turning and Transformating Spying.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how you can inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can one invent the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the size of the tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the Rider New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load Knobs are used for this purpose. each plug-in for photo can be saved as text file and then recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it may take a long time to get a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time by the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo blowing by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently underestimated operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be clicked by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the blank, use the button The blanking button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"" "below in the dialog, you can set the" "" "Max." "" "button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide help so that you can better compose your pictures. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangles: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid charterlines if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spirals will bring you good results for your photos to your goal. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flux in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spirals. there should be something that the eye can be placed at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equalateral triangles. diagonals to place a static object can be more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Settings and Vertical View options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you keep the camera vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Slide your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. by pressing Preferences, you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformieren Zucken from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically trim function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a little bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called point of reference. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit scanned. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double such strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to trim the picture with transforming cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a right angle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single loop this effect is mostly negligible, but two chings generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has some nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transforming cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, edit & digikam; the file in image processing will be displayed. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam. in the Configuration section, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. you can find a more detailed description of these file formats in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save loss-free when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read very helpful guides in English under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the & digikam picture converter.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw which is in & digikam; contained. hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web site of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. & digikam; understands these formats and will generate preview for the movies. & digikam; is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built-in possibilities to display or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digikam; the & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in & digikam; included. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft sign, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a consistent dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applying quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. left of it allow five buttons to change comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="725">& graphic viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are used free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. until now there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; includes, are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphical viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well-integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs.</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & calendars; recomputes the graph and in & kgraphie.com;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphie.com; in a & Promotional; component.</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting around 1000 knots and one hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphical viewer; is an & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphene, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Removes opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt key; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphie.com; can also note your decision so that later on. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kgraphie.com; set up, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside a current & kgraphie.com; instance; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphical viewer; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During the program start, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come on a page, will be adjusted to this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph engraved on several pages with no headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Store page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">Open the page opens the ability to determine the behaviour of & kgraphical viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphical viewer; you can define a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked for each startup.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears in a single click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlappings as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unprepared graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for the generated graphene a jump spring model layout. it uses the Fruchterman-pure gold-heuristic, and includes a multigrid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Circo; algorithm directs the node circular to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for non-generated graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this option is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the -mouse pointer. with this mouse-pointer, click on a & GUI; element to get more help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of the changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphical viewer; is an & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools to display. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphical viewer; in the Settings menu, you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid net in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">A new icon creates a new icon. if the current file has been changed, you'll be asked if you want to save the changes. then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template, or whether you want to start from scratch.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module displays images and provides tools to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source like Video Streams. to do this you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">If you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values of ducrhe. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scan button to view the image. the estimated file size is displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button, you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore generate very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots if you have selected in the menu impor- &gt; screen shot... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have read the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay sufficiently high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialogue box appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module Calendar does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="785">This module will archive your albums on CD / DVD media with the K3b fuel program. you can simply select the albums to be archived. an HTML interface can be created for comfortable navigation. also, the AutoPlay option is available for Windows platforms.</seg>
<seg id="786">KIPI modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions. you can integrate additional menus, keyboard shortcuts and other skills into the program. you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management system. with Flickr, it is possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos in the world, put photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr user module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are led by the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is therefore virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log on to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed to Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access rights that the module displays. to upload, you need authorizations. the module does not currently support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">This button lets you select the photos that you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as key words during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Familly options, you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before upload, the photos before uploading are changed in size. size is taken from the value registered with maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Galerie-Export is a tool for export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI Modul Galerie-Export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the viewing dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera settings must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is set by an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a series of photos at the same place. since the dialog is aware of the coordinates of a call to the next one, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. to do so, select the relevant region and enlarge sie.Take this repeatedly through until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a HTML page image to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encode UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right-hand side, you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have authorizations. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Clock to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mice. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the color information occurs. this can be found, for example, in the PNG file format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI-Team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out Exi2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create via Tools MPEG Diaschau to launch the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio, where you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start coding the movie with the coding button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that codes or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp image processing. this is, for example, useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dps better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently, or use them later otherwise, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the orientation orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog using the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images and drop them down to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Pay attention not to send many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the GMail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments on the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG file format under the Menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted for lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not want to change the photo quality. otherwise, we recommend you JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files in JPEG format, the original exam data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program is automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window will appear with questions like you want to have shown your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the filename of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop. you can then abort it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can browse through these images, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, in other words, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your images and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both people can be seen. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the imagery of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use an & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the image below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to select what image you want to see for each individual. to do this, you need to open the picture view window (described in more detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your preferences and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can see this dialog again on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date for which to be searched; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog box, if you start & kphotoalbum; start for the first time, or select Help the menu entry kPhotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name says, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar shows a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview preview) and also the time line displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line, so the timestamps. if you select an area, you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time line.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). the following part of the User Manual describes the in & kPhotoalbum; integrated version that you can access via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose if an & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you will find more information on the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select what information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is shown to the viewer without a description. note that all pictures are from a party. note that all pictures are from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so, it can scan your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL, where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. to allow the import function, see, properly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described here have all three based on base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time doing this, you have to do with & kphotoalbum; you don't have to do this job again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and import.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the menu File exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL that you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File exporting... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To manually copy the .kim file to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically to copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most of the images are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so anyway, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum frame size. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Importing... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folders the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you name the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your images, about (2) searching and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. many places in this manual are talked about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; note the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kPhotoalbum; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kPhotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you will see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 button and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It is described in how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the Dialogue Options, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explaining all groups of a group as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiplug and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are used together with each other, it may be that the modules are tested with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures The & kphotoalbum; demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, so it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that KIPI also use is that the other applications put their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kPhotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order by albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with and kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply fits the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people, for example, will do so, so if you would have selected people to the view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select in the modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar you see the window that you can browse through your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any image with notes. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by assigning people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: if, for example, you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can, by making the used names move up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected remarks for each image separately, you may still want to edit all selected pictures and annotate these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the pictures before and back, which are located below the thumbnail of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at a time with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window showing the US as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment panel it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the keys that form the frame's top edge. you can also make your own window from a frame by pulling it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... allowing you, among other things, to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then window / hide. this process is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you have set no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse down with the middle mouse button, and try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window open with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview window. simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and select either the delete button or select the Edit menu item. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images, without you stored on the hard drive. of course you have to have the images stored somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for pictures 5-9, so that you can preview these images. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from folders and back into it. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now, if you want to avoid fuss about how to mess up your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Menu images, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible and click on current view locking in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can see and unlock the menu item everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item to unlock, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to display the images again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with the verx.xml file.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours to describe is natural that you want to see them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information that you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard it. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser will show matching entries to this page. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture icon high and image down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful viewer's ability to switch from & kphotoalbum; it's possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire place on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can easily pull out a rectangle with the mouse button. the plus button zooms in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the key button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key button, the zooms, so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work in videos that come in and zoom with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the picture using the script functions from the context menu. this does not work for videos. you can add comments to the current image using the menu point annotation from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set on the image. at the moment you can cancel and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to mark the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer allows you to view images with characteristics while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this picture you see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so if you print, print or whatever you have selected, simply add any notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view. if you display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply expressing the character of the character after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the painting from the context menu. to exit the painting press the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation on & Povray; should be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire-model views is shown yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object that has already been selected, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the Edit menu bar or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene first.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can view the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When editing a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in landscape view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and there will be a small cross in the wiremodel view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Objects are displayed relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need another order, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below an existing view, drag the touch water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, pull the keyer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to remove a view from the anchorage, pull the touch on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the chamberboard.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamberboard. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are pending, you can anchor them in any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View Window order... Save it. it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 update. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol Rendering symbol in the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render-mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi... menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, it makes sense, but it is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop-down selector quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super sampling describes the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold, a latch of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection computes. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel will then be transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler does not support the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, import the source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag items from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source text for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your document and version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window-type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you tick the ground, a floor below the objects will be rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section, you will see how to create and store window instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Standard window fitting: shows all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window alignment when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window classifications shows all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with diamond card you get a map view together with the previous view and hovers the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window fitting:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (bottom right). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera. simply click on a checkpoint with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the view of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you might insert a cube (insert Finish body cube) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the input button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the plane, even at the moment only as a finite finite. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should postpone the floor to exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pigments. keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the Quader and Sphere in the preview, just click the Apply button and then press the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called single-color. in the coloring-list you have to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "in the" "" "object" "" "tree, select the colors in the view of the object properties:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the application button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the floor to one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click sphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click on Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection often result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracts is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer takes hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) through each pixel on the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene, and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last revert command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option preset short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tools toolbar for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually, without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the & LMBn; or the return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image is to be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script whether all modules required are present and use a kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">The require 'corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebarking v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the simplest way is to use the dcop command, which should be attached to each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being generated. now, the script could write more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected playlist files when a user-defined menu entry can be used. to remove the menu you can use dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, cleaning up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packets are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expansion of amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page by & amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category of amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a specific title for thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's Collecting browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Normally you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & amarok; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the configure script at compile time. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be fulfilled for them to be used. for details, see the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activating debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& amarok; can be set up without any trouble on the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1210">When the player window displays, the player window will switch to the playlist in addition to the playlist. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use moodbarometer: this function is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option switches the experimental function of the tuning ergometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">More atmospheric: this feature is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar, which changes the colour scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Voice files in the music files: this function is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files. otherwise, the .mood files in the Settings folder of & amarok are stored (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & amarok; it should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save the playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping the current piece visible during the piece change causes the playlists window to be opened / unrolled to keep the piece running in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is being picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of various fonts in & amarok; set by selecting Custom fonts, the otherwise gray described section will be activated. you can select typefaces for the following area: playlists window, player window and context browser. press select..., you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">By selecting Custom color scheme, you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme. use the color selector activated among them for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playing at the start, that & amarok; after the program start, resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The on-screen display will enable you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors to customize OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas will open the dialog for color selections. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can determine which screen of a multiple monitor environment will appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output flashcard lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate more settings in this flashcard.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting as with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & amarok; both the selected and their subfolders will be searched after music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enable & amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & amarok; all found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) are added to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, another device in the MySql subwindow is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & amarok; on calculator: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. after that the network port is entered under which the database is reachable. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load card last.fm aligns support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows & amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Similar interprets call: after activating this setting, & amarok; a list with similar interpreters can be retrieved to the played piece. note: you can see the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will provide trouble for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can locate the file by typing ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, taglib will crash when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the libraries used by & amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, disable autom. disable if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-infos, but they are not labeled as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easy to forget.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarocapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify the / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most plumbing problems are resolved easily by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or for developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenoei.net on the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter only one error if there is anything to fix an error in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only appears a blank playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the surface, the Start subwindow was converted into the statistic window. you can find it under Extras stats.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces you need to see the review column in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column to show review. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] short commands. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, then press Enf on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From playlist remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it down there just as you'd like to do it with other files. that's how simple it is: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the playlist's toolbar, right next to the Add button, the button playlist is stored. click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Probably the program xmms-config is missing. install the xmms-devel package and install & amarok; new. look also for libvisual, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">None. yes, that's true! no! & amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question is: what media types does GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support pretty much every only imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you will use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoders are provided (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST online update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & amarok; play MP3's off: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device needs to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously pass audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you might need to specify a different sink (e.g. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you want a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. activate sound servers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDED codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the quicker arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver was highly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components and register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (stop Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then execute drag-register, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the latest-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Please report this at bugs.kde.org. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes, please send it to our mailing list: Amarok-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>

<seg id="1295">My personal folder $HOME lies on a NFS drive. after the start of Amarok the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages. what now?</seg>
<seg id="1296">The internal SQLite database of & amarok; doesn't work with NFS. either you need to link ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok to a local drive, or use Amaroks MySQL support.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Set the CD, then click audio CD in the menu. it opens a file browser with multiple folders. for normal reading, switch to the wav folder, select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Konqueror window. instead, you can instead take files from the folders mp3 or ogg.</seg>

<seg id="1299">Basically, this adjusts the previous assessment with a diminishing value based on how often the piece was played. the more often the piece was played, the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You can add the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window. then you can change the rating of a piece as much as any other attributes, by selecting with the right mouse button on the piece and press F2. you can edit the rating also in the Metadata dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Developers do not want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amarok. this means: KDE packages have a specified publishing plan that cannot be combined with the scheduled Amarok's scheduled plan.</seg>

<seg id="1310">Now I have & amarok; reinstalled, but the output modules are still not appearing. and now?</seg>
<seg id="1311">You probably need a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program. even though GStreamer is installed, the necessary developer files are missing. the same is true for xine, you must install xine-devel. after that you need to recompile and install xine-devel.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context-browser shows different information regarding the current piece. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information shown there are now divided into other parts of & amarok; also, the information can be collected in the statistical window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The sub-window of music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>

<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. you will find information about using this filter in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box, which allows you to filter out the last added pieces to your collection. you can also select your entire collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an entered URL. for example, when you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file music.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping them. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: by this the dropped files are inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>

<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search gap, you may also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is searching for all the pieces that either include Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click the right mouse button in the desired order. entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>

<seg id="1488">Void copycd () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void burnDvdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString equivalent) void createFolder (QString equivalent, QString parent) void pUrl (QString parent) void removeItem (QString path) void removeItem (QString path, QString Quartz) void setupware (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createData CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; read out for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoding using these WAV files (compression). currently lame for MP3, oye c for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. additional encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format, or also in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something by itself. however, only the Kodierer packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not required, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction about codec, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio creator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD;. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can circumvent the protection, it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD; otherwise simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting-up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), then the daily use of reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, over which you stumble frequently in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, all of which is manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Configuration menu - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it is to be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoder tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so an already read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog for the type of notifications (such as logs, picks) for program events (like reading the & CD; end).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main installation dialog by & kaudiofile; with different cards (such as encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important, since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. still needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genuine for music from young people, portable devices and auto-stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320Kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or by the program automatically retrieved from freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / needed with & audio creator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the CD title to the keyword (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiofile must be added; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of video creator; parameters that can be used (= button identifier in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiofile; is active to select a check box (Send a address). for the use of freedb can be used with a different (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when fetching the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if you are using freedb, the nearest mirror server is to be used geographically. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org delivers a current list of mirroring servers for the online call of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from CD & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be set on the tab for setting the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer suite has to be installed from the Linux distribution, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined codec. more information on Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and write permissions on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codec of your choice (lame for MP3s, oye c for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete handbook, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine since it is regarded as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course always.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure you have the / usr / share / cd directory and that you have screams on it (eg by trying to copy something in the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of audio-creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them in each reading of a & CD; if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the selection program to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing device names for CD-ROM and / or DVD drives helps.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab card General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional transformation can be defined. in our example, everything is displayed in the same way as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information, please select, so that you will be notified when information on creating key words (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The flashcard CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately when you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename will be changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection boxes and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode, if you want to use the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls are running the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit any data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check out the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Set everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi systems. the resulting bit rate is approx. 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in the case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be codifying at the same time: in a dual-core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to encode more than one wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & audio creator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create an MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' copy of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, seek help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window blended, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current title' input field, the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'Current title' input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below can be used for individual comments, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v2 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comments section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats. see Help for Kodiver to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the resulting CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the selection button selection of the selection process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you are trying to work with a Kodierer that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format. this means reading and coding parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration option to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in case of low performance machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the codec of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">As a part of the kdemultimedia package, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions contain already pre-compiled package, da & audio creator; a part of an important & kde; package. if you are reading this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adjusted to your needs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different mapping maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading this? even if only the help menu after the first start of the program was clicked, without any indication of how to go on from that somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual on & audio creator; however, whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it. and if you read this, he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and others both. some pieces do not have a text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don't have to set anything manually. so if you select automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke lyrics will automatically be selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a certain type of event, select text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarise. these are played out in series. in this section you'll see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu Collection under the point Organizing.... Click here to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then entering the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the selections in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be stored. keep in mind that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection it needs to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add a song. it appears in turn, the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequences of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, the entry next song from the menu item, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Conversely a song to jump back, select the button Previous piece, the previous Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define keymap "Another keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices which are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI's patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order, nor omit a line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds like a gun. to do this, add the following to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it will take Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the concept drum patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used above all to map out sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch, all events will be ignored that attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">If a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM presumes that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try it.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, just open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select Settings under the Point sewer view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the single instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happened because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -Window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop when the collection is finished or I want to play a file, just go to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off Automatically Add to Collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the settings Automatic Add to Collection and open Amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play out B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; LAGA (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; LAGA. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write to me an email: larva @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list under friends of & kmid; but if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get money from anyone. I would like to point out that I only want to reprogram because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarva / kmid.html. on the homepage you can track the development, look for information and view pictures. you also find links to sites with further karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the Category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you are looking for an entry, your group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the playlist's menu and either select the processor mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the processor mode is abandoned or another group is selected without the same playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / Rem.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end-animation, the user can thus end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be your favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / MPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc like the setting up of the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special embed field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE are given.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process is called knpplayer. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always take a given back end for a certain Mime type (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be seen, the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. the code to be used should be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained therein.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, it must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlresource, vcdsource and vrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as root after entering the device. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance?</seg>

<seg id="1777">Once the above sample source sample has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Build or the Quick Construction button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Cle; execute the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched in accordance with the errors. when using Quick Construction & Occult, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are made only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, italics, underscores, etc. can be added. these commands end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language was presented, a step-by-step guide is now followed for creating a document in & Kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few passages in bold and italic expression and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by editor-View or Ctrl E (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (d. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file printing (in viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source text has been created, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only modern under Settings box must be set up... tools to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the preferred search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on forward looking. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer happens then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Occult; with a single click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; opened and bound to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Oepiece, as text editor (Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur while using the & DVI; if an error is present, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can then use the Previous LaTeX Error and Next LaTeX errors for brittleness. to view the flawed line, you must click on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the error line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a document, a document can either be re-written from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using a file New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this manner, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default size.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if an easy way to create a template is being searched, one should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability to read and extract from many different types of text files (including & bibtex;). many settings for & Posters; can be made directly from & boxes in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in & latex; and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; which means that by clicking the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using arrow keys with pressed shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can insert additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu entry points or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump. this also highlights this jumping brand, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; Even though & Posters; already excellent options have been added into & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is added. & latex; always renders many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Exceptions, the following commands are included for text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides). with one paragraph there is not a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also includes & latex; commands with a back guard (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To solve a part of the document, it can be selected at first and removed by pressing the button def. & Placards; provides the button root Ctrl; K with which the entire row is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for faster possibility. under Edit Removing, the following commands are included to resolve the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands in the editing environment for one possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many remote ambient commands, the above-mentioned environment can be lost quickly. this command fills the most recently opened environment so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under the Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the ground opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the ground closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested truncated groups-brackets, the above-mentioned group can be lost quickly. this command fills the most recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & box; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the back button is pressed, the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list is displayed. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing pointer marks Next, and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all of the plug-ins contained and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other in a project. & quantaplus; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by searching the team member from the list and press the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS once it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties Dialoges can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such ladders are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note input is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the annotation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) will play a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up using Quanta Settings... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including code completion, it can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">"" "large / lowercase of tags:" "" "large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal" "" "bumpy" "" "means the tags are inserted this way as they are described in the tags XML files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1951">Upper / lowercase of attributes: upper / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal capitalization means that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if requested, is inserted for tags for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Non-optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish day automatically: when switched on, the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatically replace accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mime types for detection of different types of files. using the default button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is ejected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modifying the MDI modes and docking / hanging from views. it complies with the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages section is used to control the display of warnings by hook of no more requests.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL and the source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the figure of the parser knots in the document, can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the click of a mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of node in the tree, the updating properties of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s valid, divided. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifh abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from the third page, which can be reused by any part-compliant application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Enter: this information is passed to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is checked, check & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select to save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely new. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debuggers. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen Session Starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a Debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be shown in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution continues. if a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a request has been requested, the execution begins once a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include in error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and move to the next as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Open a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog lets you enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is an & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus & quantaplus; a fast, easy-to-use & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, open & descriptionrc; and tagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic boxes of image buttons (above the edit pane), the text and instructions can be inserted faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.day) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog, which & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick inserting of tags into a document without risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folder contains only the & descriptionrc; and the tagXML files. tag Folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but a single element of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for any attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies source code for attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tags%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list together. it can only occur for an attribute description only once. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any leg rupture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is set up in the above & quantaplus; -windows to start and check tagXML. another dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following one example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The open descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD processing DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = default 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set up with Settings... set. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button abbreviation assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailiated settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries & quantaplus to find the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are substituted with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Select text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be redirected accordingly. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, on the default output. it can be indicated what should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in given cases, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use, enable dialogue "Edit Tag" if available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start date, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly dismissed, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user should be signaled that clicking on this icon will insert a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, as it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the toolbar to adjust dialog toolbar dialog. make sure the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like, for example, a quick way to access Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus, repository, if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2.html tags.</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc just after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separated resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an E-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) to send with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others can download them. entries are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a single contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for what it takes a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose a key.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menu, upload toolbars toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be needed. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions Line: the string that should appear in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to take full benefit from & quantaplus, you first have to familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the dividers with info and the toolbar. please check in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a contextual menu with the current document, like closing the current, other or all the parent, reloading, deleting, or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window there are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; PGT; in your document, then click on the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate them, open them and wander through. in the presentation with a share holder are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available script languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. more functions are available via the right mouse button, such as starting, editing, or emailing the script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other tree views. with it, attributes and namespaces can be changed. the entry system geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two parloaders at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all the errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive on & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can backup them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, extendable markup language editor would make it? well, this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what already someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; rumor is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffer Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML, when pasting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard into & URL; -write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Editing and switching the problem report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphic files to your project folder or a subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Create a dialog to add a new toolbar. actions must be added using Settings... Edit tool bars are saved through toolbars toolbars or you'll be asked when asking if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be replenished without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu of the tags / actions on this toolbar in the tags menu.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion using toolbar is denied when this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the kate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line ID. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that matches the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting a job will activate the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add and change sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in line with the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.eu) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host configuration, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Ask if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can select a precise selection of manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of the files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook-up or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders are possible), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the above, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Event configuration can be done in the event configuration window and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a particular event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you cannot influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are also active, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten with programmers. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk drive option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are written in & quantaplus; the best way to distinguish tool bars from the menu. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is handled in the section Adding tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a New toolbar can be removed, tool bar can be renamed, tool bar can be renamed, or toolbars can be set, which can be specified, which actions should be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action will be displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings tool bars... and set actions to set actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions one imagines for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions indicated at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents are written in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document should be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As Template Save As a Local Template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree below project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be stored in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headlines and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; shape, insert files or associate with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things in using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set a folder's behavior in the template index, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded once the parent attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">In the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like a text module. if nothing appears, you'll probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows prior or postscript text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right button of the mouse) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reachable via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor if necessary, in which the implemented changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP contains, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit, continues to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is running synchronously. with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, the push button moves the active cursor from one window to another, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a single click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL editor. this can be done with the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of looking for pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is possible as in word processing, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way using toolbars, as in the source editor. note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchors tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the Tables Assistant or the Listen Wizard are deactivated. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for studying style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge a complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging a folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and complies with the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make typing easier by typing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Standard Folder 2 folder 2 folder Cardiff3 Folder 2 folder Cardiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows to manually typing filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialogue remembers your selection and shows it next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">The folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the matching or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to set an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag the text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the thought behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing of text into another program as cut and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while above the line.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Changing] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe button to find the resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump to the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to the automatic merging or by manual processing; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the source file; this is only a substitute for the case that you change your mind and possibly yet again select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore the options Numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">When you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, right, high, down, side up, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, see how you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the File Window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / final distinction, to the next / previous distinction (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture downwards) or the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if enabled, it will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option because you could inadvertently overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the chosen typeface does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be framed. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically displays an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the incoming line indentation will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is omitted then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a line supply '\' at the end of a line, while others only save a newline character, although they are different. if this option is checked, they will be disabled as a white sign. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective for complex and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">This setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict is skipped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white notes are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must stop & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if enabled, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for the encoding a brief reference appears, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informational character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can define the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; gt; B, A & lt; gt; C or B & lt; gt; C will appear next to the normal still a second oversight column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply skip the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful to display long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this function e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only in the line interval. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff. but for this an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further preprocessing command for line comparisons. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Replacement / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different with perl. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for display and merging. other operations only change the data that the line interval algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merging. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small news window informs you of the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that were compared to that time are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically chosen. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and when the option folders are synchronized. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & kdiff3; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merge (unsure) then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, the error message appears. if such errors are not removed, the merging of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging one file is executed after the other. you status column indicates Fertig when the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all interconnection actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C is used as a destination in the three-file merge mode, B is chosen as the target and the A and / or B will be used as a destination when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries may be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to select only the current entry: select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options passing, Simulate, and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; execute certain actions with all entries. if manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select the directory merge and continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, then a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a bug, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you can select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, it notes & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them later. even if the merging has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate samples can be entered with a semicolon; valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a predefined pointer marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In the case of links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: when the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; does not result in possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered to be the same if they are the same size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modified date has been lost. please use caution. this option switches off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the more recent file is proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed the knowledge that the other file has not been changed. you should check it in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal compilation of single files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view will remain visible to merge individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can turn the option directory & text windows to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text windows.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking it. however, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">But this status is lost if you read the directory again: list -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters need to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder. then, a file is always assumed to be a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permission or change date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date differ from the original. (note the option of Confidential of Size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first ever the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3 Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; run as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or will let him go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will not be treated identically. if similar lines are next to each other, this is the most often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required to do this has been too big so far. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src has been left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; use & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems while compiling. however, if you encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift removal) paste into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) paste the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder during merging. if the destination folder doesn't already include these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the source with the labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is downlighted. farewells in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') will be treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the blank background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries Pager... and exit. if, however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, the & Kpager will display the names of the virtual workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual worktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names will be provided with ordinal numbers, eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; the main window can be determined: classically allows & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual worktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and shift the windows as symbols or with its contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch-switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as root user or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete guide for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag; start a window as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, it increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can display a selected screen area in the magnification window (dropdown mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the dropdown mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier icon. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, when you press the Shift key or Shift & Mb; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the drop-down window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kid; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to later insert it into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the display refresh. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor has stayed in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer pain on the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can use the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may cause pain.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this: even if & kmousetool; avoiding pain caused by clicking with the mouse is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart shifting is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click navigates.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the mouse is switched on, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button is waiting, before releasing the mouse button again, when no moving takes place in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the Generel General. there's a slider set of sound buffers that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will be started; at any start of & kde; this feature is currently only available at & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the user's last press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool, first of all with the default settings. in particular, the smart shifting should be turned off at first. if you then get used to the automatic click of the mouse, you can later take the smart move away.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when a move has just begun. if you use the smart shifting in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of ktops; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid specific defects of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the ongoing orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">A message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who just enters the space. & kde; notifications are also messages. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you get from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for issuing longer texts, which don't have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined strings of strings that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speakers, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, the text will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or an & kde; notification of & ktts; sent, it is edited by all activated filters installed on the bottom. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters installed. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the setup of strings of strings. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the matching substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only needs to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here. you can also select multiple languages when you press the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers you have to omit. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 indicates, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply when equal. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string representation filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited to both sides by separator (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package deutils.</seg>

<seg id="2651">The voice selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker set up on the karabcard speaker or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by a female voice from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; there is a text attached to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker attributes that present the program, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speaker set up on the Karteikarte guide. with the speech selection filter, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression set. is installed on your system of the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in the input.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with each speech synthesizer, which can be started on the command line in a & konsole.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages at rate. also consult the website of ktts;, after information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech "speech-Dispatcher" program uses a customizable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you wish to extend it for use of any other synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, compile, need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you are using the source code of & ktts; from the source code archive for kdefiles or downloaded each night currently created tarball, translate and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, check first whether speech dispatcher works properly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech discs is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can return sentence or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can indicate the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; choose a speaker, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add on the Karteicard Add-in, and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the Poster Set Box setup is shown below. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. when votes are known, this setting is automatically made. generally, Western languages are using ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some regulators and display this grey, the chosen voice will not allow you to change these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with bigger memory consumption) the first movement is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click on Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, kttsmgr will be displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise after startup only the symbol kttsmgr can be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not run yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are performed, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the precisely edited proposition.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Using the buttons in this row, you can proceed to or back in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of multiple sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will shrink to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts is not installed, instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKoen, click on the audio card. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Only text orders are performed and managed here. issues of Screen-Readers, Warnings and News are not displayed. more information on the message types of & ktts; see in.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, it has been & ktts; either compiled or respectfully compiled without support for the appropriate audio module; it is not possible to load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If you want to use GStreamer or aCode for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you need to install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speech speed here. 50GB;% corresponds approximately half and 200мм;% about double normal speech speed. to allow these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & Desktop; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules set up in your system. most of them will not work. you will need to find out which device works with you. in doubt, select Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the orders received are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks out messages. if you want to read a long text on a website, you can go to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, & ktts; the audio output queues in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played prior to the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and output of screen reavers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; pre-read KNotify messages, run kttsmgr and click on alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable the reading of & kde; -Notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktats; reads no notifications before.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications where a sound is played are from & ktts; not pre-read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message that & Conversation; sends out if someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktats; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selection box to specify what & ktts; do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following wildcards:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired subscriber. default select the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the list of cards as top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a specific application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. the last option is to carry out the action specified under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The All Notifications for the Application Standard (All other Events can't be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the default notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications in a file. the loaded events are merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except All Notification are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes marks for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently it supports and ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, the festival uses the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 1005;%, SSml lyrics are usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and set limits filter (SDB filter). SBDs teach text into individual sentences. this allows you to start typing faster, because only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limits detection filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit filter filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other set limits filter filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set the subscriber selector by simply trying out. switch off the speech selection and select text for pre-reading. switch back the speech selection, change some features and check the selection of the speaker. of course you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start faster with pre-reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the default string detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator mark (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering). note that the default set limit filter preserves the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limits filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can overwrite the subscriber settings for the application on the Karteicard Speaker Selection. the flashcard is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card card speaker). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker with all the features of a subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original set-up properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also place multiple markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is, if you know that a specific application is text in another language than the one set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In order to use all the features in the Speaker range, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker button and then use the Spokesperson closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is in the queue for the last word order. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it's started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and & ktts; you probably have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x, you must register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & konsole; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the ALSA project (dmix) on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed them and can use them in the festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / solidialint / vocals, add the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermodules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the karabcard for subscriber unit. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSml.) deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -according to SSml UmformerFilter, and set the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesperson, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER doesn't seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file converts to convert from SSml to Saber the GENDER-tags. same goes for the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a special string translation filter and now I can in & ktam; no more rules to proceed or go back. on the tab orders is shown, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You can't filter punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for set limits detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts; execute the command registry. (HTTP: / / gstreamer @ freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users are involved in audio output related to ALSA. if your system is also part of it, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. it freezes when you stop a text order and then start another.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKoen does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed, but otherwise it is not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install sox with the apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & ktts; as tarball (tar gripped archive), register as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you'll find help in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices you need to input the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding like koi8-R for example.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & linux market distributions. therefore, look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then the festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This guide explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;..</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolCenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu; Start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device actually shows and allows the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are being installed and installed on installing & Linux; with installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting the module network settings, this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the option to select the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. by marking the setting of non-recurring questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can be viewed only, changing the settings is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... arranged in the device dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode allows TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start, so no further setup is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration can be set. in the IP address field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & konsole; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. if in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2833">The installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) is enough if & kde; and Qt is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde will not suffice, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, and in the second chapter, all of the configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace previous knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to go through in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; the network administrator is the contact point which holds a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be arbitrarily selected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a particular area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses in the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 has an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes also dynamically altered for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which in addition offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was answering a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be embedded in & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; howls the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. notice & kdat; don't recognize the credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects and kdat; the pre-credits, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you'll be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been involved. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by folding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; exists by changing the symbol for the band to realize that the integration for the band has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use data to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; this process must be formatted before you can format your tape before using it. floppy drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, & kdat; with formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog box opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once again and change settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears backup. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the testing process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Restore menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your choice once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the tape indexfile on the basis of the tape. this process erases all existing index files for this volume. you can reconstruct the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are stored, such as the folder. folders mounted on other filesystems can be separately registered under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; & lt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reboot version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is inserted, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the spin at the tape drive. this setting may not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, you will automatically discard the tape when solving & kdat; do not use this option for Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide fast access to information about problems appearing on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog provides users with fast access to information about problems appearing on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - to open. if you don't see it, and it opens instead of it a small news window, you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or after entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, also select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the process column, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar; this will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are indicated with a more prominent color than the protocol lines of the step hint. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window contextual menu to allow all new protocol lines to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find more up-to-date information on the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly becomes the standard for the control of program start-up when booting the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an Init file. therefore, you must be sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following more folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you will be able to repair it by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user run level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens when they pull out an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The serial number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently, there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sort number or name of an entry, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delivery (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check that all configuration files are available (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adjustment by & kuser; Read More.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a flashcard will be created on which you can set individual settings. additional flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management tab appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations each in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and alter the boot password, change the time to the boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
