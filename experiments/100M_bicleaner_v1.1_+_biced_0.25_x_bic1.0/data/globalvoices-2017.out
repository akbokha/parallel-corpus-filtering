although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts covered the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only ampli@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stays behind the mountain , as it is said so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ ine@@ e .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not recon@@ cile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had come to know during my time in Phoenix .
like for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ et Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; playing at the game .
ling@@ ering intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values embo@@ died by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ ine@@ es Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white people , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O.@@ B. ) : white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash playing on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now s@@ ling@@ ing country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
Bild von Fli@@ ckr user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments .
a school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn &apos;t live with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from re@@ manufactured material , which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ y ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land @-@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash to music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly ten@@ dered and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to give it a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , was a part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then drove the prime minister out of their waters .
they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions today happen in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship is charging his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which the eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , ph@@ ant@@ asy names , fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; they purpos@@ efully use the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t run my port &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found fle@@ eting ships .
based on its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more accurately .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , in partnership with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and , by means of which the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide can be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meeting the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what they &apos;re doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and have hardly expected consequences , know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the aim of even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member of Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets , which are meanwhile banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also in@@ filtr@@ ated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong signal that they approach illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and , at the same time , the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s official release .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , whose eyes were negotiating the political and economic crisis of the country , re@@ acted by meeting in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the rec@@ uper@@ ation of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including Bar@@ inas , the Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ lying non @-@ federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans due to an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change during the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ but@@ ary at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows in her latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ al for many was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round Table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called on to continue the process against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the next day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were to continue to block the referendum on the renewal of office .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : the National Assembly , Friday nationwide and on November 3rd , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; Re @-@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the guards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and the armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which forms the scale of repression a day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment procedure - it has now been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
the Chron@@ icles of Shakespeare : Romeo &amp; Juli@@ et
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your inaugur@@ ation !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has done little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fies against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cor@@ doba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets to himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the 141 in La Per@@ la prison in 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there , I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with an ERP .
pass only that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because so my father had educated me .
at the military base I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went in and saw a lying down on which men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
she un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was terri@@ fic ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to someone else ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye band@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors of the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged with the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , gave the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Sh@@ anz@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &quot; boot@@ y of war &quot;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that the boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military pun@@ ctu@@ ation that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but if one walks into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ als cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , beat me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is my Father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of the time I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes to his house .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now that I &apos;m older I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been exec@@ uting people during dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ nap kids ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I kept asking myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mort@@ al remnants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , of course , anything remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt refresh@@ ed internally and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I raised the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 and finally committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended prison sentences and nine prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were claims .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , Tor@@ ture , and R@@ ape by Offic@@ ers . # Es@@ say terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years in justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research carried out 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government gave up the land on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license were witnessed in the last month evidence of a particularly un@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was presented on a sign , wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with a malicious h@@ ind &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was taken to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , the latest in the Kyoto magazine , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bad English translation was removed first . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper names &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture also ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a bit more detailed about the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents in the country is quite an occasion to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share thus rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned version of the article brought comments on the light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this not the reality ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The translation is not correct , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and pro@@ active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the belief that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be native speakers .
thus , a French native lingu@@ ist , for example , should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language that could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations prove that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , Kyoto &apos;s city will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) from the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups opposing the Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it &apos;s amazing that it &apos;s still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby DNS servers answer requests for certain domains faul@@ ty .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses to request such a website .
we are confir@@ ming a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay too many girls become slaves in order to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ son as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mes who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly talked about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ m@@ son for the family . as a cri@@ m@@ son , Paraguay has more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as a Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and , despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude being ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ mes is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , the daughter of her daughter in the belief that she is able to complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and might even be star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon occ@@ ured in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent strokes . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she served as a civil servant in the household of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra stopped at Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ m@@ son .
organisations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela held the practice of the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ent Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mes are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all of their work and started selling sweets on the street or market to earn money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in doing so she had to divide the time in such a way that you still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to be hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings , the house owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but didn &apos;t stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they felt I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord fear@@ ing that they would lose the education they had made possible , explained them .
but it was perfectly clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken is mo@@ bbing and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ mi@@ š if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society cheap the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .

bill scri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by the Parliament , users must be registered with a government agency in Egypt to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and is cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video @-@ axes and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is unclear how they should account for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a us@@ ername and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook ; due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network .
but until now it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously then it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committee before entering the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ gent nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ w@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which runs through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to portra@@ y a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North East of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a perfect pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map .
even for this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years after it was made to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the pol@@ l results of the affected persons themselves .
housing development in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement b@@ ill@@ ings ( the S@@ sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation shel@@ ters ( S@@ kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) has to be res@@ ett@@ led into final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in housing shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , more than 36@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear disaster have greatly affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to make a living .
is the native population preparing for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough was done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es .
how it is for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disa@@ strous , atomic disaster that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the status of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated camps are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be part of the Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries speaking different languages , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that a more united than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer wearing a bat@@ on against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . in the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer were beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel made by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the net , in which you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs immediately hur@@ ried to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do calls for further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group were sab@@ ot@@ aged only to crimin@@ alise teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him with a stick .
police hand@@ gri@@ ps of the police
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police missions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers stood at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively model their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are supp@@ ressed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tations with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce of the Un@@ forgotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane plants all over Cuba closed doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane plants were paraly@@ sed .
after the succ@@ umb , the sugar cane industry remained quiet in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
other res@@ igned and p@@ add@@ led to the factories every day .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane plants in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the p@@ int , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why is the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they only left the factories producing sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people , got their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first school year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that differ@@ ed only with respect to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
against his will , he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ horse producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane plants
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Volks@@ gemeinde Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to interfere , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other factories .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a perspective of the future , many young people also left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , and its production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine re@@ eds give the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops managers have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ oll@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &apos; Highway of tears &apos; , a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs remains despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always native languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chorus is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop , who gave them a straw in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in cap@@ tion , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one ever was interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also move forward with our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , readers and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic meals ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin and pur@@ u ( as well as &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they want to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies producing the same plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ l@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phones decorated with plastic meals , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food mol@@ ds is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
this part was also made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for your mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the compass .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # h@@ ash@@ tag # at the h@@ ash@@ tag # out of the h@@ ash@@ tag list@@ ings .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the commun@@ es who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trafficking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only fear us in order to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is named Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not get paid out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for a few years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from the files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they mo@@ cked those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also torn apart their family apart .
you think of all that you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how about growing up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he only removed a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ ms ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages he links contain pictures where violence is represented .
the factor check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to insist on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the East of DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets of the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank lor@@ ry fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie nearby , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses scattered and scre@@ ened bodies were scattered throughout the streets .
many people were burned to be un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident depic@@ t the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the following period could only be illustrated with satellite images .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt by the B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly pursuit of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a announcement , published by the United Nations , those who escaped were able to flee , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , bringing these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , wrong@@ ly claimed in 2012 that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of this false dec@@ ou@@ pling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information boundaries can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed @-@ mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and community and national publications , and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded wrong reports , some others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for abuse .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the orange map ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of incorrect coupling of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available about the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false messages .
the grey states are examples that , according to metadata and information , are available through Tin@@ eye , probably also present fal@@ si@@ fications .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that lets rum@@ ors rise up posed in doubt that the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned photograph shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a Qu@@ é@@ bec City B@@ logger is not only pointing out the false report , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria , they burn Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , clearly no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster have seen that dispro@@ ve this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner is silent . &quot;

Iran , 2012 .
a Association of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy for the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , to deli@@ mit the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , since the photos were ab@@ u@@ sive .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a rec@@ tification of what it called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional glo@@ ved news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of smells staged by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had been granted His 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture remains in it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , the Catholic near An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ tili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning the world ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and compare the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as that here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo contained , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , the Tin@@ Eye is also available , but are no longer trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and Time / Date St@@ amps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and sometimes they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which first appeared clearly after the original text of 2010 , the image ultimately may bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that these posts go through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ate the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to be discussed about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but it can also be used dis@@ solving from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ cers ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist decided by &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Check your parents in recognition of how to have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they mi@@ tig@@ ate other cultures , reveal other types of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite wines here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , normally used at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the shore .
after an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missing because of the floods and mu@@ d@@ deposits .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people have been transported to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children warns after more ra@@ inf@@ all is already on its way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da village near G@@ alle was also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the air force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
several organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on floods and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who wish to don@@ ate dry food and vital substances for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster recovery center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me caused a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in safety and afford relief measures .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , with the population of Sri Lanka that is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a loving friend .
I trust you my four years old daughter ; she confi@@ des in me her children ; she is my rock in the midst of fire .
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we will make rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of rain @-@ umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they have muscular me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into , have to be dispos@@ ed of .
can be allevi@@ ated ?
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love for you ?
peace of mind ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western vision , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translation of his poetry .
this del@@ eting ren@@ ders a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this cur@@ ly visual language is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic woman who should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ member@@ ed the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these paintings still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to cover them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narrative domin@@ ating our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US couldn &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who are leading movements for change .
it is seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought in with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the 1.7 billion narrative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is African @-@ based Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ invented the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ir@@ resisti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ap@@ preh@@ ensive about Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ching my Muslim recipes or carrying out my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information , which our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the shelter which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she was winning a contest of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi recently .
it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims consists in how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ ah , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been colon@@ ised through an &quot; Empire &quot; for centuries , which a company founded with the name of Dec@@ ent British East Line Company , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried out to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family dominated by India , who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslims means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story happened a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ a sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deeply back into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy w@@ anders the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assassination attempt .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ fold .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that are being bombar@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which mostly targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , North@@ western University researchers showed a scientifically incorrect image and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial print@@ ings that we are dealing with in our news outlets .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our often identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IST , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an ir@@ resisti@@ ble Muslim .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?

we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of what my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we envis@@ age a new future where we have no pres@@ idents who are bombar@@ ded by already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
story @-@ telling , by fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding , these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the audience getting involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical to her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the story of the h@@ are and the bab@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how is it possible to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story telling .
Puerto Rico calls on the US to re @-@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which tot@@ alled 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ an Church Convention Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
Puerto Ric@@ os people demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be ref@@ unded with falling pension payments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island - not the sovereign territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions imposed from outside will be in danger without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vision for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ BS@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of books completed by so @-@ called &apos; book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was d@@ ashed out of the A@@ dra @-@ Pris@@ on &apos;s directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up from times of extreme convi@@ ctions in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention for Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ Pris@@ on , a non @-@ military facility , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; had taken Bass@@ el as the &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who pres@@ elected themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently managing director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were more fores@@ ighted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations and here mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do all this , to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this retreat into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book handling by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit us ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the wre@@ ath of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in detention since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : after release of corruption convic@@ ted of corruption
with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption incident , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence , in which corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused of em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from the public funds of Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose Council was appointed Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for a good tour in 2016 and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who submitted the motion , there would be no grounds for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after its detention .
however , many people do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we are aware of is that the company should also insti@@ gate a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison term and half of which had been cut off .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaking .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting b@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook inst@@ alls the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( split@@ ting b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ asi@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cy@@ ber@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; curing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech to radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical before it sol@@ ases all posts suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ phrases is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or are simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asks for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred to the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that they have begun to do this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally spur the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for failing to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which forbi@@ ds this practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members detained Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public cry . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this has been done not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys in 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to create laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of the children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of ministry in the Ministry of Education said :
it has used too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ises the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth nearly every price .
while Abel was of the mind , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &apos; , Out@@ standing News !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years of age regardless of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft law on the amend@@ ment to the marriage was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 representatives in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the orph@@ an@@ age is no longer permitted by law .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations . thank you very much .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to dissolve his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate about the subject differently .
Patricia Vor@@ rell suggested :
rather than talking about the problem of talking to the state in our bedroom , rather than talking about the problem , we would rather talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men against them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws they fail .

on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday - the website of the prosec@@ utor was hack@@ ed by the district Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . hack@@ ers have left a funny message &quot; Sta@@ y at home .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page , but in the cache it remained intact .
no problem , no problem !
on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ news to the local news service that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can again view the content of Wikipedia
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally black@@ ened .
produced by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey is now blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist@@ ed the lock .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several error pages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are now sur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all on putting sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content on decentr@@ alised and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it merely refers to screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar lun@@ atic sites if Wikipedia is banned in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported to Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and co @-@ worker at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a winding rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned motifs and washed @-@ out colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , for he stood before facing Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to shoot in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
please take a look at some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care must be taken to express the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , and fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced by a false court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and the village community after having appe@@ aled a married relative with name .
the tradition of their wives also does not exist in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer instructions to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ ba@@ al campaign running by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the degradation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as orph@@ an@@ age to HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time turned them to ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they have all been responsible for and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wants him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is .
she showed the video of her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she was only chu@@ ck@@ ling in front of her during the exercise ; another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the red @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the mar@@ ital status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my husband that I would carry the red point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped working , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ oon @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
regarding the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini affir@@ ms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear vermi@@ lion in their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn @-@ around in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when Beat@@ les came to Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves all .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on is supposed to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , of course , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies use the fan base also commercially , like this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of single persons for organ trafficking , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to c@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique with bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police for the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ gang in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the region of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dis@@ believing rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this also calls for the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog poor S@@ nai@@ ve who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ D GER@@ MA@@ NY A country where people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , to demand work and other services , a nation where people would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men would be hun@@ ted for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ ets that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ quit@@ os authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply concerned about the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our sincere con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in the Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who had been publishing themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a heard about Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing the honor of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web movement .
and we appreciate all the efforts of all the people and organizations that have campaig@@ ned for release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , including the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly forced by the regime are tortured and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; sub@@ version &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said a speaker , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to give him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
United Nations Uni@@ fied nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate treatment abroad for Li@@ u abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , even though the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , since exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( in German )
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she shared in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States ( USA )
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s request attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to intervene and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley said China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice upon which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany ( in German )
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
diplomatic sources in the news agency Reu@@ ters reported earlier that China had great concerns whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney earlier told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk and contact somebody outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um nar@@ rates :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info was already reporting that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan , Republic of
the Council of Party affairs in Taiwan prompted China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and wealthy China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Justice Minister , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noticed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the minister of justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he advoc@@ ated an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
however , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re comes up again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he tar@@ red corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by releasing his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of an ever @-@ growing generation to make such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice told in Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he truly believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reject an error &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their own country ?
who must our prime minister pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , has always been a town :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans might cook in anger if they are kept for Americans but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .

Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - prior to Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if you were to switch to Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be idle - like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to push .
to be harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to attract attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau consul@@ ted the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just nice .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) from the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells us what rules his girlfriend takes .
although not expressly political , the music video relates indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video on the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under Jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which grants absolute discretion to the commander of the Army about important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that over@@ sees online content and prosec@@ utes persons who are accused of slan@@ dering the monarchy .
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( insul@@ t of maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup by the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long jail sentences if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the sal@@ ute from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ eva are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eastern Ab@@ and@@ als , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most Russians and ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the area amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly climbed over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where the laundry is dry .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they pull back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mine company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( growing agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and growing vegetables .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Eur@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells them that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ equi@@ vo@@ y@@ ness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ est@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and is published with kind permission .
on the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ est@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden coloured ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy bear @-@ form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ak@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - however hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outdoors on cardboard boxes .

she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits you because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
seb@@ as@@ ti@@ ao is travelling with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before , and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send messages when they have gone to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ha@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small home .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ha@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single mother , offered him a roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to take the next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travel@@ er quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who left .
like a proud grand@@ ma she fli@@ r@@ ts in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she imag@@ ines her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone on . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10th July , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had news with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is to block por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded , ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published in China , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen flash@@ ed the inhabitants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requirement that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected by a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .

the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all government sectors , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible offen@@ ders , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything scre@@ ams for death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one who gives honor to her name .
one who has put down a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality cat@@ ches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out to death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even when the Earth is on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents have , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn up during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that was stuffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice re@@ fut@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me also hear how you scre@@ am &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you had forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells .
I knew all the details before I was in charge of the room .
unlike other people , they have probably assigned me a bigger cell this time .
I have to share them with just one more prisoner and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called the doctor .
in complete darkness there is no striking sight in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .

the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
a li@@ ar is a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ eled themselves on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the horror presented to us in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played out their con@@ fession@@ al heritage map and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I attended the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have grown accustomed to not responding .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was not important .
some voice in me said that I had to accu@@ stom myself to be punished , even though I did nothing to deserve this punishment .
punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cries were not yet enough for him , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables into each other to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour , three of them inter@@ changed while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find any favour in it , which is why he picked up next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity went through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half bare body lying stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours went , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry about terrible sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you &apos;re going to be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shr@@ inks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ ia &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ha@@ ye@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questions their proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes like orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa within Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind , and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version to U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
added by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ uts in water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the si@@ ps speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you have a look at neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled due to the vo@@ cal@@ ist orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to decide &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably shouldn &apos;t be simply a sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflects an increasingly clear and cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b resor@@ ted to traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premature sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in the past years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orable su@@ ici@@ des reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on fighting crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not do anything .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known not to shy away from subjects that long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been in@@ ferred to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are at the core political can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to note later that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and in his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , stre@@ amed , but only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly promotes the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not alien@@ ated from Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in his memory thanks to his hom@@ opho@@ bic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ wa , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of Parliament and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they have vo@@ iced critical comments on issues related to the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial democr@@ ats .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are many theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing come from a time when armies of the West mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ary to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , held a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two hard cars are to be seen .
nevertheless for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely were external appearances and personal care as important as in this story because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ou@@ ter@@ most limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we built up this educational community .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel dis@@ b@@ anded ?
exactly this question came from the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación campaign , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , having been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : by now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year who needed the most urgent need .
so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colum@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were transferred on 19 March in one of the UN refugee camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ sort travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between them , &quot; told Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly my tears ran through the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly and sat down beside the gar@@ net @-@ laun@@ chers .
perhaps he was tired of war too , was tired of being the faithful companion of this com@@ bat@@ ant , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new votes to vote
at the start of the event , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the State exer@@ ted itself on the whole Colum@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and realizing that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate , were just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a dam@@ iana worth over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there , did not come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic at this time .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after reports published that dealt with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ yan authorities who arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ former , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States last time .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ former who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was going to fet@@ ch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , du Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to get along and to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which in@@ doors were you laid - in those of men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window I had a car with dark@@ ened windows and a plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that something was lazy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering me , without proof , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and thrown them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really try to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably download the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not many .
if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to ask themselves of Cad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown .
since then there has been nothing new about them .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 , I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it was now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ zing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked up ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore pink jeans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me even a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people started to change in the city .
he who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came home , I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily worse .
OC Media : what activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise tea re@@ treats , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t pay any c@@ ents for that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I discovered these people myself when I cut off the places of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to fool you with foam before the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ er have which , the cab@@ inet@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months , there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ulation hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ation was so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights said that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job because of persecution from the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable used areas for Iranian agriculture .
in spite of these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of un@@ handled diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lay .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture and the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and completed 45 % of a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of newly emerging ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be employed , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists hit alarm before the situation is explo@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is watching and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I get to speak on skin color , racism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we face black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner lam@@ ented in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dre@@ ad@@ ful and mar@@ g@@ inal@@ ised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of campaig@@ ning for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ released .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explained us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ man Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - dedicated to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the main focus of her work is on persecuted , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by the cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people concerned .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had been violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to abuse , there was no use of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed ad .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever submit an ad , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence , in general report to law enforcement agencies .
content 1 Stri@@ ke and Statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a schol@@ ar research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are several sources and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney General for domestic violence , and 70 % of them revol@@ ted around violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the Cour@@ ts of Peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here as well .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay due to psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who don &apos;t do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should always be regre@@ t@@ table .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer meets Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would ever become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told them how he had insul@@ ted them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have some blame on it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former spouse ab@@ used her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads in the authorities stayed without a result and also from her relatives , she did not receive any support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for@@ You ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d is to be declared an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to also gain members of the law who feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be lev@@ elled , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een that much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry on themselves , if they just want to provide an advertisement and get a safe accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the cause of the perpetrators to escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to provide such a long indication that mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the passage on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media continues attacks in Oman one year after the publication of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was prohibited because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but were later released .
since 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had ab@@ used his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , notably the Intelligence Service , the freedom of liberty , including freedom of the press , to restrict human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and arrest other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically obstruc@@ t peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bound hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publishing and spreading the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited on August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was held in front of the trial in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ vals ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit was set up in the amount of $ 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his release of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also aboli@@ shed the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still looks after attacks by the government of the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and which the Minister ordered once again against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was inf@@ ring@@ ed in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of print on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to stop its operation .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j gives the impression that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling for the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under any circum@@ stance that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including court har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of association and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his approval
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have grave consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and a lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched HIV virus before deciding to go home to support the Sam@@ b healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
Q : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this entry from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the US since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rot . as a result of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security concern the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der lying around which I have to pedal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in front of the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source breeding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ ress species in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it is tested there , whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of gro@@ wers and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Management Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding se@@ ed@@ lings with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; says he and takes stock of the ever @-@ increasing fu@@ sions in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples include the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are threatened by farmers in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative also ple@@ dge to keep their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking as a result of increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it either impossible for plant breeders or even more difficult to use .
such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are even more patented than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desirable traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much less predictable .
in an e @-@ mail mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ esses promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not prevent innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not support innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in Oregon and Os@@ si Management Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation masses of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just gent@@ ri@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are smaller but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) possess patents , most smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders should avoid becoming more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , with which I think it is really easy . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is an open @-@ source seed programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , which is why the Os@@ si requirement cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows for patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .

in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend toward pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start of the seed should be planned next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .

human rights organisation and blog are the latest destinations of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these objectives further , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles he writes in Egypt not accessible web pages and media .
now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , is accessible on the other hand .
Zi@@ ada , a former photographic journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting about the student protests and taking a video , how the police force physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada comments on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even though the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now that they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous will go the way to the end .
according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Association , Egyptian authorities closed 133 web pages from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
we also documented the blocking of providers that were possible by circum@@ vent@@ ing Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
Afgh@@ ans reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis with which they can act against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ine rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 force of violence reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for example , on 16 August , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the editorial , &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to establish a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision as follows :
it will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . but what is happening in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry out : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; damage more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital only .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police facility and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decline in violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor municipalities that actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention as &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the situation in Rio as a war also raises grave consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use resources and methods that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost glob@@ es . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police climbed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
Quelle : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region east Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that have committed massac@@ res of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas have been under siege in Damascus , leading to the fact that inhabitants are locally produced or through tunnels and control points attributed to smu@@ g@@ gling food .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food im@@ planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting for this project and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more known . &quot;
in order to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of some 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Production of Mus@@ h@@ room seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , car@@ ton , etc ) to generate new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires which ramp@@ ed up in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for a period of three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 qu@@ arri@@ es spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached .
a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande in June , where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas via satellite photos alone , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spreading across the web and show pictures that allow a better insight into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the goal of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to limit the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão mund@@ al , the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports from open streets that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ection@@ able by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this kind .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , as inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it uses the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and became the decisive factor in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website had more than half a million hits .

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups had broken out , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

please leave this field empty :
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many of the haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af re@@ found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sack@@ cloth with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site on which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af has left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin ratios , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was putting all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ an companies , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants sprang up .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily , when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and manufacturing techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he would also like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : violations of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , have been in custody for more than 900 days .
he reported the evi@@ ction of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
share @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ative &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users must register to use the social networks within six months after the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and its identification number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the tri@@ but@@ ary of a criminal payment .
the law , which was applied by 60 members of Parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another MP filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ ting of the president or a senior official would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law the insul@@ t of the president as well as government institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the law proposition , such action would be prosec@@ uted with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tahrir for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years &apos; imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen , while testi@@ fying violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the President Mohamed Mor@@ si &apos;s departure .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a trial date .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , floo@@ ding of among others weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ ok@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists interro@@ gated documents interro@@ gated by Tunisi@@ an activists
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption @-@ accused Official Am@@ nesty , provided that all the illeg@@ ally received funds returned .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April , sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their badges ?
according to new regulations from the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
in addition , the regulations stipul@@ ate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts are suggest@@ ing that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is up to now not clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then let &apos;s see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information broad@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Land government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ kal@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has a ban on Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as barrier in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications reported that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
United Kingdom can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time , and to install MS @-@ programs which de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
