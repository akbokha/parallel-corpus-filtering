<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I've been as if that's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only amplified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fanatical love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stays behind the mountain, as it is said so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had come to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpet Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" playing at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lingering intolerance also contrasts with the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to nominees Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white people, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (O.B.): white against all other ethnicities; white and whiplash playing on white and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now slinging country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Bild von Flickr user OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, viola, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn't live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from remanufactured material, which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic MÃ¼lldepony) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land-fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash to music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly tendered and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to give it a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority, was a part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then drove the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">They exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Director of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions today happen in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship is charging his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which the eight members of HISH-i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasy names, fish-protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they purposefully use the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," says Long. "earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You mustn't run my port'.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, in partnership with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and, by means of which the position of each trackable ship worldwide can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "meeting the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what they're doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and have hardly expected consequences, know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the aim of even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member of Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used trawl nets, which are meanwhile banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also infiltrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong signal that they approach illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and, at the same time, the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">Their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "recapture the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's official release.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's request to a referendum, Venezuelans, whose eyes were negotiating the political and economic crisis of the country, reacted by meeting in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recuperation of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including Barinas, the MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central-north-lying non-federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans due to an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change during the inauguration of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-butary at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows in her latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine, the referendum on impeal for many was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (for example: round Table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called on to continue the process against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. "in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the next day and a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were to continue to block the referendum on the renewal of office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: the National Assembly, Friday nationwide and on November 3rd, all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and the armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State of TÃ¡chira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which forms the scale of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now testifies against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets to himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the 141 in La Perla prison in 1976 to 1978.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there, I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with an ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not deceive you one day and I will have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That's why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine, because so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to annihilate papers that had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="346">Edited by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license were witnessed in the last month evidence of a particularly unsuccessful translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "the Japanese word for the" "" "elderly motorists" "" "was presented on a sign, wrongly - but perhaps also with a malicious hind & # 8212; as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was taken to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">Kyoto Shimbun, the latest in the Kyoto magazine, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could such an English translation happen?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The bad English translation was removed first. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the proper names "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto Prefecture also apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News was a bit more detailed about the phenomenon of the "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists who are involved in accidents in the country is quite an occasion to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 seniors were caused by seniors in 2005. this equates to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Their share thus rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the article published on Yahoo, the above-mentioned version of the article brought comments on the light which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to have against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation error has, among other things, received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and proactive language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the belief that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native linguist, for example, should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language that could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations prove that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordings in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often adorn T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, Kyoto's city will hopefully use a more reputable source of its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar of Libertad" portal (Free surfing) from the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to Vivoplay online.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups opposing the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was snapped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 when reporting on protests. at that time, the Commission for telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that it's still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby DNS servers answer requests for certain domains faulty.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We are confirming a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a crimson as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies from other Crimes who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Voices, courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, decaying schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly talked about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a crimson for the family. as a crimson, Paraguay has more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as a Crikazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and, despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Crikazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude being inoculated to the Crimes is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crikazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, the daughter of her daughter in the belief that she is able to complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of itself" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who receives the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of the Crikazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon occured in the hidden in Paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent strokes. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She served as a civil servant in the household of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira stopped at MarÃ­n as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a crimson.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations like UNICEF or Callescuela held the practice of the Crikazgo for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Crikazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," lament Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Crikazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimes are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik, in which her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all of their work and started selling sweets on the street or market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so she had to divide the time in such a way that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to be hungry, but didn't get unlimited food either. "I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the house owner Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="474">But it was perfectly clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which is almost never spoken is mobbing and the harassment exposed to CrimiÅ¡ if they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the North East of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, tsunami and an accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a perfect prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even for this, Fukushima Prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years after it was made to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the poll results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing development in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement billings (the Ssaigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of accommodation shelters (Skasetsu juutaku) has to be resettled into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in housing shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more than 36000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear disaster have greatly affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are located in the" "" "nuclear barrier zone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population preparing for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their empathy has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough was done in catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic disaster that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuates from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, returned to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the status of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuated camps are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be part of the Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane plants all over Cuba closed doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane plants were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the succumb, the sugar cane industry remained quiet in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and paddled to the factories every day.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane plants in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the pint, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why is the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories producing sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely enter history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people, got their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is" "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first school year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that differed only with respect to the parts that would be removed, the addressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was surpassed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the land had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">Against his will, he was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshops managers have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyollak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called 'Highway of tears', a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs remains despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always native languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop, who gave them a straw in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in caption, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one ever was interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also move forward with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin and puru (as well as "plastic models of dishes") of each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they want to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo neighborhood of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies producing the same plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin gentlu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phones decorated with plastic meals, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitsch collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food molds is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part was also made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for your mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the compass.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # hashtag # at the hashtag # out of the hashtag listings.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the communes who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only fear us in order to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from the files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they mocked those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaking up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to be spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was sacked with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also torn apart their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How about growing up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he only removed a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" project, animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the East of DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets of the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank lorry fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie nearby, which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and screened bodies were scattered throughout the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to be unrecognizably.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonated bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The following period could only be illustrated with satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt by the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly pursuit of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a announcement, published by the United Nations, those who escaped were able to flee, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, bringing these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, wrongly claimed in 2012 that President Myanmar's Than Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful themes or frames (framing) that these posts go through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence related to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliate the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to be discussed about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, but it can also be used dissolving from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of false attributions should also take into consideration how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saucers) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist decided by "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Check your parents in recognition of how to have tried in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that you feel after getting warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They mitigate other cultures, reveal other types of thought and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and flooding catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, normally used at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the shore.</seg>
<seg id="972">After an opinion of the Sri Lankan disaster of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missing because of the floods and muddeposits.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rainfall started on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Tawalama town with water stands up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa bus was in flood, water level up to 6 meters. Morogoda village near Galle was also flooded because of the water level of Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The air force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Several organisations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on floods and humanitarian aid.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The Taxiruf app PicMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster recovery center is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the Roanu tropical storm, PickMe caused a "flood aid" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. they were then forwarded for free to the Sri Lankan Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" key, which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people trapped by floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring residents in need in safety and afford relief measures.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have muscular me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">In our collective imagination, this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims, as I do not fit into, have to be disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Can be alleviated?</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western vision, the religion of Rumi was erased, as well as the most popular translation of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting renders a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi-Arab, Muslim women to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story-telling, by flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often" "" "is often associated with understanding, these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feel, touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their depiction lead to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical to her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamus tells the story of the hare and the babvian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamus is asked: "how is it possible to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story telling.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls on the US to re-establish public debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which totalled 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (citizen's front for the neural examination of debts) and the Okoman Church Convention Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">Puerto Ricos people demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt will be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer, Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBSel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, a publisher of books completed by so-called 'book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was dashed out of the Adra-Prison's directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current status or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up from times of extreme convictions in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention for Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra-Prison, a non-military facility, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" had taken Bassel as the "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who preselected themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently managing director of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes were more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the junction of numerous civilisations and here merges Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do all this, to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This retreat into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book handling by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every time you visit us,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose sight in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and watchmen</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the wreath of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile over your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's detention, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year goes by, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the time</seg>
<seg id="1245">I'm in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Basle's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians died in detention since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: after release of corruption convicted of corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">With anger, Mozambique reacted to a corruption incident, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence, in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused of embezzlement of 54 million metikal (about 800 000 Euro) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of Mozambique's airports, whose Council was appointed Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released for a good tour in 2016 and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who submitted the motion, there would be no grounds for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after its detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP), a local institution committed to transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also instigate a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "contrary" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison term and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only to be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive and - by the way - a prophetic speaking.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he confirmed vigorously that "an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fatherland for its ambitions, its own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook installs the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting blower), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalasiaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocyberer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty manner if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "curing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech to radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical before it solases all posts suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchphrases is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or are simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asks for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred to the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems that they have begun to do this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally spur the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for failing to control the rampant hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">Instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage, some members detained Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 it came to a great public cry. at that time Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere, since that, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this has been done notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors as," "" "defined every person under the age of 18." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys in 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavored to create laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying to the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of the children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministry in the Ministry of Education said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has used too much time and unnecessary talk that disguises the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and it is worth nearly every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was of the mind, it was definitely long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years of age regardless of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft law on the amendment to the marriage was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 representatives in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's best-known Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed and he seems to dissolve his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al Rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the debate about the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather than talking about the problem of talking to the state in our bedroom, rather than talking about the problem, we would rather talk about the fact that the state, our daughters, protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men against them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws they fail.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally blackened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Produced by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey is now blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resisted the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked web pages (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several error pages (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) are now surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Having heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put it all on putting snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content on decentralised and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it merely refers to screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar lunatic sites if Wikipedia is banned in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported to Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and co-worker at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A winding rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed-out colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood before facing Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to shoot in the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Special features (Department information)</seg>
<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care must be taken to express the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, and fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced by a false court from the Indian state of Odisha and infringed by her family and the village community after having appealed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not exist in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer instructions to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # Khelbaal campaign running by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paz has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as orphanage to HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time turned them to ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was of women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they have all been responsible for and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wants him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply entrenched that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some thought it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," "" "says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only chuckling in front of her during the exercise; another decided to release all the frustrated frustrations against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">The husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the red-red dot on the forehead, which shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I told my husband that I would carry the red point if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped working, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Saloon-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Regarding the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini affirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear vermilion in their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from demarcated groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of single persons for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelieving purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and some of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to cahle men who travel to Mozambique with bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Mosambian police for the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhamgang in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the region of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably disbelieving rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this also calls for the police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blog poor Snaive who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHD GERMANY A country where people would have shame to go to the streets, to demand sex against good marks, to demand work and other services, a nation where people would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald men would be hunted for disbelieving purposes or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunity for macabre humour could not be missed.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "subversion" (state endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "internal matter" "" "and said a speaker, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to give him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate treatment abroad for Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, even though the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, since exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union (in German)</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she shared in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's request attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that "no country has the right to intervene and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice upon which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney earlier told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk and contact somebody outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info was already reporting that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Republic of</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Party affairs in Taiwan prompted China to release Liu on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, stable and wealthy China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noticed that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the minister of justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he advocated an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre comes up again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions with non-replies rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his commentary on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the title.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore is" "" "no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of an ever-growing generation to make such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice told in Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he truly believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review outlines the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "reject an error" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the junta who seized power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) from the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what rules his girlfriend takes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video relates indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video on the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times shared and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin Video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular how it behaves with the situation of the country under Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup by the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the area amounted to 16,000 people, having hardly climbed over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapestula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and golden coloured earrings in teddy bear-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapakula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - however hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outdoors on cardboard boxes.</seg>

<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before, and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>

<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>

<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small home.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>

<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single mother, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to take the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10th July, the cell phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had news with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app was able to investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is to block pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on users' experiences in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded, ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based Media Outlet "Images from mainland China" published in China, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen flashed the inhabitants randomly to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requirement that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected by a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After Jingwang's installation, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government sectors, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police station.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenders, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was not important.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to accustom myself to be punished, even though I did nothing to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all their diversity.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shrinks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaia's family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felhayeyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questions their proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa within Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind, and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion to U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Added by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee from the second generation," he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he shuts in water NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sips speak lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you have a look at neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front man Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "was canceled due to the vocalist orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continued to decide "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably shouldn't be simply a seizing rhetoric, but in fact reflects an increasingly clear and crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resorted to traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premature sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has increased the number of 'honour killings' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorable suicides reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on fighting crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known not to shy away from subjects that long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been inferred to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are at the core political can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words, "get what you want" - whether faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to note later that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and in his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, streamed, but only a machined version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly promotes the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not alienated from Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in his memory thanks to his homophobic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwa, who was to work later on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of Parliament and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they have voiced critical comments on issues related to the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial democrats.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are many theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing come from a time when armies of the West marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissary to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two hard cars are to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were external appearances and personal care as important as in this story because they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the outermost limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts face each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (other videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we built up this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel disbanded?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question came from the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la reconciliaciÃ³n campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, having been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: by now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year who needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Columbian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred on 19 March in one of the UN refugee camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotsort travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between them," told Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "suddenly my tears ran through the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the garnet-launchers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war too, was tired of being the faithful companion of this combatant, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes to vote</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some of the FARC leaders came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the State exerted itself on the whole Columbian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and realizing that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate, were just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the rounds through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was going to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, du Schandstain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to get along and to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which indoors were you laid - in those of men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window I had a car with darkened windows and a plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without proof, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and thrown them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it's the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really try to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably download the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to ask themselves of Cadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new about them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003, I was already known in Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it was now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to lead us to" "" "civilizing" "", "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked up; I had dyed eyelashes, wore pink jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "the security ministry of Sharia has never curbed me even a hair." ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying:" "" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who laughed and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came home, I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea retreats, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">"" "" "" "I don't pay any cents for that." ""</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cut off the places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to fool you with foam before the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaner have which, the cabinetines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transience to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegulation hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incineration was so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on site warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights said that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have appealed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job because of persecution from the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the richest and most valuable used areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">In spite of these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of unhandled diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahrazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a number of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lay.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture and the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and completed 45% of a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicides among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "Dohimi said that unemployment has become more recently worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of newly emerging ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>

<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and to be employed, because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">"" "" "" "given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activists hit alarm before the situation is exploding." ""</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I get to speak on skin color, racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" sing Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we face black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner lamented in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dreadful and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of campaigning for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explained us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," Musa tells.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had been violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to abuse, there was no use of Ada BÃ¡ez's well-informed ad.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women ever submit an ad, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, in general report to law enforcement agencies.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a scholar research institute in Paraguay. "there are several sources and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads went to the District Attorney General for domestic violence, and 70% of them revolted around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the Courts of Peace. 86% of women's ads came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"" "according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "" "there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay due to psychological abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who don't do this because of physical abuse," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this should always be regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer meets Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would ever become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told them how he had insulted them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have some blame on it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former spouse abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads in the authorities stayed without a result and also from her relatives, she did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an impenetrable judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill introduced in the Paraguayan parliament was discussed under the hashtag # Porelas (# forYou).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft law stipulates that Femizid is to be declared an independent criminal offence and to punish harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points, in order to also gain members of the law who feared that the road to decriminalisation would be levelled, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen that much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must carry on themselves, if they just want to provide an advertisement and get a safe accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the cause of the perpetrators to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to provide such a long indication that mistreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The passage on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his approval</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have grave consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and a lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched HIV virus before deciding to go home to support the Samb healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Q: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the US since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carrot. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security concern the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but he now needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there is a boulder lying around which I have to pedal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in front of the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open source breeding (" "" "open source" "" "breeding)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶mersalat of the Outredress species in the "glasshouse" of the station. it is tested there, whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Foto: NASA. all rights reserved.</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of growers and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Management Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed also plays a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seedlings with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," says he and takes stock of the ever-increasing fusions in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples include the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are threatened by farmers in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative also pledge to keep their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is in jeopardy because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking as a result of increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it either impossible for plant breeders or even more difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are even more patented than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desirable traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, since" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietesses promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not prevent innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not support innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant traits: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in Oregon and Ossi Management Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation masses of herbicides are needed, breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just gentriy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are smaller but smaller than Monsanto) possess patents, most smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes that breeders should avoid becoming more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years, with which I think it is really easy. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest destinations of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these objectives further, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, for example the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles he writes in Egypt not accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to bypass the Egyptian government's censorship, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is given a home, is accessible on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photographic journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting about the student protests and taking a video, how the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada comments on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; A arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous will go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association, Egyptian authorities closed 133 web pages from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">We also documented the blocking of providers that were possible by circumventing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afghans reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis with which they can act against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in an operation in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thine robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air coffee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 force of violence reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For example, on 16 August, the newspaper "Extra" published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the editorial, "That is not normal," in which she announced to establish a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">It will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. but what is happening in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry out: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guede, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" damage more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues against the violence as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital only.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A Peace march in NiterÃ³i in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honour of the murdered cultural organiser Rafael Lage.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia, is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the morals per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Apart from Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police facility and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decline in violent deaths. for some years, however, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor municipalities that actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention as "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the situation in Rio as a war also raises grave consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and methods that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a "enemy" where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost globes."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police climbed the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region east Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that have committed massacres of the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas have been under siege in Damascus, leading to the fact that inhabitants are locally produced or through tunnels and control points attributed to smuggling food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible to large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" "" "life saving food source." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food implanted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to raise money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of some 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires which ramped up in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for a period of three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 quarries spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached.</seg>
<seg id="2837">A similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande in June, where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas via satellite photos alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objectionable by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, as inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it uses the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and became the decisive factor in this fateful weekend in October that the server did not resist the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website had more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many of the hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf refound himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sackcloth with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site on which we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf has left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous voyage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin ratios, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "they are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained way of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf was putting all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghan companies, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants sprang up.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily, when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and manufacturing techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he would also like to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported the eviction of the camp of Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Share @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocative's Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use the social networks within six months after the submission of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and its identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the tributary of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by 60 members of Parliament, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another MP filed a legislative proposal in which tougher penalties for the insulting of the president or a senior official would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law the insult of the president as well as government institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposition, such action would be prosecuted with prison and fines, so legal experts of the Tahrir for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years' imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, while testifying violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the President Mohamed Morsi's departure.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, flooding of among others weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case a criminal court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for reporting on the pro-Morsi session blockade at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samokhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated documents interrogated by Tunisian activists</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly endorsed a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption-accused Official Amnesty, provided that all the illegally received funds returned.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April, sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the naming of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their badges?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations from the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, the regulations stipulate that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts are suggesting that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is up to now not clear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "then let's see" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an" "" "organizer of information broadening" "" "in the Land government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014 thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnokalniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has a ban on Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias barrier in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website. it is, in addition to China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">United Kingdom can't stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time, and to install MS-programs which decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
