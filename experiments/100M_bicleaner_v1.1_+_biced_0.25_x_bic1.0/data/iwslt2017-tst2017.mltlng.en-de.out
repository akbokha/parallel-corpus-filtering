that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones by Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has identified cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are revealing .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many bold repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of separ@@ at@@ ting and bringing tears to the statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly concerned his telephone inquiries ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit specification , and even travel documents with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , justice has condemned more than any U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
almost every article on national security has been the result since September 11 that whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in touch , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they request would not be available from the start .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to do wrong . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee , the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who wanted to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you very much .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Spanish law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup it ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ G@@ ris@@ ham novel .
it seems crying out from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is , when the rich and powerful are capable of conce@@ aling their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , disclosure is phenom@@ enal .
around the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and mask their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems to be very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it as a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff soup .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans who came up with this scandal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , there is less information needed in some U.S. states to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator as he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian , ent@@ angled in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very dull , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot of things to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been regi@@ stering at the national level in central registers , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
representatives of both parties have tab@@ led a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now still allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale on the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aking on ti@@ thes to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in my childhood were actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ?
being home to my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
they can then invite strangers to sleep over the Internet to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this soft touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone now ?
could you please tell on Twitter that he has opted for the Office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements , all say : &quot; he really can hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system enhances trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give up negative assessments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence .
it is not surprising that we trust the people most who are the closest to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have fewer than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not previously been covered .
for us , business is going very well .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately for the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction of a fraction was a problem .
for people were right to trust each other .
if trust works , there can be wonderful things .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only recommend it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions ?
it is a question of economic commerce .
but to call it simply &quot; rent industry &quot; now does not do justice to the matter .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are sharing a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place one visits , a group of residents would wait for a thorough ref@@ illing and to show one of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project was already started in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were searching for a ble@@ ach were offered .
were given to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality already before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you very much .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the check @-@ up at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in relation to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively embra@@ ced my parents &quot; faith .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast to the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying into buildings , people jumped from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me from a citizen to a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the United States in order to move to a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I was -- as we drove silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday this week -- the day Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was looking forward to the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were considered Muslims to be dra@@ gged into free .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you very much !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant look at people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c involvement .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me that people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed before a computer .
as first the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can bra@@ in@@ wash , which leads to the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you very much !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they don &apos;t exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised them a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive aven@@ ues for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia relates to me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept author@@ itarian regimes , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if people present messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
maybe we feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
by assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain to yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we opted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove quietly , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , went out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed us and welcomed our guests , because half of the collected were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had urged the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might asser@@ t that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a land@@ lady with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air parcel service penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting air units , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space .
you can also build on self @-@ reli@@ eving structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be known collectively , where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most startup users , it can float , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s all .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that get together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight unit . it was invented recently .
it only has a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folding , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is quite simple , it happens very much in the interior , so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the winner is an exercise in vig@@ il@@ ance , this machine is an exercise in abundance with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is first symmet@@ rical .
for this reason , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if planes are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making half @-@ f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration explores synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we recorded commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motivated you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press on the side wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us is the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes were or@@ biting each other faster , so they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not expose them in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events in the first place .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Interfer@@ ometer Gra@@ vit@@ ational Wave Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of LI@@ GO could be increased significantly , which significantly improved detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes swept through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories , such as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stretched to the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lecturer in theory of rel@@ ativity often lead a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and dra@@ ined by the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the LI@@ GO staff went crazy .
with a laser detector five kilometres long , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic essay about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott likes to say LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
sounds are different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to relate to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LI@@ GO , the measured frequencies lie within the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just around : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this sounds so : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- LI@@ GO heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; somebody who knows what to hear , this recognizes as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic . ( translated with Google Translate )
and we know about it because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as never before was possible .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
much in space , we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ia stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them all .
the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own illumination .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are things we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , LI@@ GO did things we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as LI@@ GO keeps them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang for yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dreaming with us .
thank you very much .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected degree . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the small one , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ tens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ aked cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , get up to life .
dream job . vaginal sex , big dick .
no , no .
I am a titanium .
dream job . vaginal sex , big dick .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes :
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 different languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a titanium .
dream job . vaginal sex , big dick .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just about the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dreaming about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I put troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
so when you play a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and wis@@ ely , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a sw@@ am starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go forever on her .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does them .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I started to work and work with television production , when I began to work and work , build , create , and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the h@@ um is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive to be different from size .
the feeling of not being different than to strive for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not a failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to clarify one thing : the more I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things are observed , the more I write history , the more I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the sum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , working weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all their heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , and know how the bu@@ zz feels when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
do I still have a titanium ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my h@@ um is consuming , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy thrust comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real h@@ um is .
the hum@@ ming is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true hum@@ ming depends on love .
the hum@@ ming is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real h@@ um is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real h@@ um is simple and original .
the real h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I usually do this , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ wer@@ able to me as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ?
well , I do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we r@@ ushed in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .

my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the Mother of the Year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can take 15 minutes on the play , even on a bad day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready for bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ essness , my world . it is not necessary to be children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with one &apos;s own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll reti@@ re and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes per piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the sum@@ ming of life .
the sum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s me schn@@ u@@ ppe that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan when he &apos;s going to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country that I create , the mar@@ ath@@ ons I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often took care of patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that brain trauma is s@@ wollen with cereb@@ ral brain trauma and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on to the pressure of the skull .
to save lives , one has to reduce the pressure of the skull .
to do this , sometimes you have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from tissue samples is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations .
however , this is not so certain .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to keep track of them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t - aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what happens if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and mat@@ ured exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been m@@ apped .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we colored in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously re@@ covering up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal oneself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one needs to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit with TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable cal@@ m@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism necessarily leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece .
at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies will be mi@@ tig@@ ated , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies wasted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks of Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which throws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations that are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , in England and in the euro area , in all the well @-@ being producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds after a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , like in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , as in a continuous loop , encourage the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful nature . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy as a result of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ed into questions of state interests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept for a long time -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines very bright , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two has been taking place since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , the economy gradually under@@ mined politics and ex@@ propri@@ ated it .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the way they used to be ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is due to the fact that today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds on , that at the end it star@@ ves .
the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a disease @-@ like surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines are serving people and people are putting their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there but they do not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
suppose the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans .
but above all it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you very much .
the Oxford Shakespeare : Romeo and Juli@@ et ...
you describe yourself as a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not working , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays off -- is an area of economics -- a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say it as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the Great Britain of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill !
he was particularly skep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can observe in China now resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to us , and the denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues , which threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal to reveal this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have still chosen denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a Finance Minister or any Minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought it was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they had been conducting a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they fail to survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
it will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fris@@ ée and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard fought field .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows addic@@ tive , where , after watching a squ@@ ad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about falling on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle sco@@ op , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch free for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and result in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says something that should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good TV , right ?
when data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , in spite of the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies lie wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis could predict the break@@ outs of flu , aw@@ ful species -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great sensation sensation . success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publishing in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data is coming to an end in decisions of life -- at work , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very wise people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put bits and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first competing for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to steer our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ques or No @-@ Ques@@ tion you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
