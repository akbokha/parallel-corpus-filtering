<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally listened to telephones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has identified cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many bold reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separatting and bringing tears to the statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly concerned his telephone inquiries,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit specification, and even travel documents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, justice has condemned more than any U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Almost every article on national security has been the result since September 11 that whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in touch, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they request would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardise us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to do wrong. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who wanted to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Spanish law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying out from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and powerful are capable of concealing their wealth in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, disclosure is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Around the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and mask their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems to be very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a matryoff soup.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these figures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans who came up with this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, there is less information needed in some U.S. states to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all to a lawyer made proposals to our investigator as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single leading politician, entangled in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot of things to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the last few years, we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been registering at the national level in central registers, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy who get up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency, which now still allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale on the farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaking on tithes to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in my childhood were actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Being home to my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something for it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">They can then invite strangers to sleep over the Internet to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell on Twitter that he has opted for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements, all say: "he really can hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system enhances trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give up negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is not surprising that we trust the people most who are the closest to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "" "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great works of art in your home! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not previously been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately for the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction of a fraction was a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people were right to trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">"" "I can only recommend it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled over this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">But to call it simply "rent industry" now does not do justice to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are sharing a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place one visits, a group of residents would wait for a thorough refilling and to show one of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project was already started in South Korea's capital Seoul. lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were searching for a bleach were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the check-up at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-aid and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant look at people of other faiths, and to show greater civic involvement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me that people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">As first the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremists can brainwash, which leads to the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you very much!</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergyman with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised them a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive avenues for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia relates to me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept authoritarian regimes, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if people present messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">Maybe we feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">By assigning collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove quietly, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, went out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked us and welcomed our guests, because half of the collected were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had urged the courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might assert that you're holding a TEDTalk, a landlady with draught, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say don't fool you. I'm totally normal.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel service penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting air units, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build on self-relieving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be known collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most startup users, it can float, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: one propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, hinges and cross rudes, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is quite simple, it happens very much in the interior, so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the winner is an exercise in vigilance, this machine is an exercise in abundance with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is first symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">For this reason, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If planes are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half-flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration explores synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We recorded commercial micro-quadcopters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivated you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe press on the side wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us is the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes were orbiting each other faster, so they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not expose them in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of LIGO could be increased significantly, which significantly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes swept through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observatories, such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stretched to the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturer in theory of relativity often lead a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and drained by the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that's why the LIGO staff went crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a laser detector five kilometres long, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic essay about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott likes to say LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Sounds are different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to relate to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice speaks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies lie within the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just around: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds so: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- LIGO heard the following: [Surrender sound] somebody who knows what to hear, this recognizes as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic. (translated with Google Translate)</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe as never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseria stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen, however, in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is obscured by its own illumination.</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first attempt, LIGO did things we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as LIGO keeps them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauerkraut for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang for yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You are dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Do I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected degree. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the small one, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things out, get up to life.</seg>

<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each consignment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes:</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 different languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>

<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I'm not just about the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I put troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So when you play a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and wisely, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A swam starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and humming sounds like a busy street, I could go forever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does them.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I started to work and work with television production, when I began to work and work, build, create, and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The hum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive to be different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than to strive for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not a failure, and I only know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to clarify one thing: the more I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things are observed, the more I write history, the more I write history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work institute.</seg>

<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, working weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all their heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>

<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Do I still have a titanium?</seg>

<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy thrust comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium frame, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real hum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The humming is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real hum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real hum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real hum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually do this, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not answerable to me as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>

<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known ones, the "deep-brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted an electrode in the brain to influence the neurons "circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often took care of patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain trauma is swollen with cerebral brain trauma and contagion to the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, one has to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, sometimes you have to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from tissue samples is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">However, this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to keep track of them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the collection point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant - autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what happens if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and matured exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been mapped.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we colored in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovering up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal oneself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one needs to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit with TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable calmness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism necessarily leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies will be mitigated, our future gloomy and our great new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks of Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations that are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, in England and in the euro area, in all the well-being producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds after a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, like in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors who, as in a continuous loop, encourage the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful nature. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Athenian democracy as a result of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighed into questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not kept for a long time --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, a relentless struggle between the two has been taking place since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, the economy gradually undermined politics and expropriated it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the way they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is due to the fact that today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds on, that at the end it starves.</seg>
<seg id="947">The power of the corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a disease-like surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the film "matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek" in which machines are serving people and people are putting their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long discussions about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from redeeming, and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there but they do not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Suppose the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trash of history, and keynesians, globally keynesians.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="979">The Oxford Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a Libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers describes as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore I am a Libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not working, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays off -- is an area of economics -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say it as provocative, China resembles the Great Britain of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill!</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China now resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to us, and the denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone and continues, which threatens the development of the whole European Union massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first proposal to reveal this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have still chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Finance Minister or any Minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought it was an honest interest in the lenders' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they had been conducting a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the troika of the lenders, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they fail to survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">It will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisée and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought field.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows addictive, where, after watching a squadron, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about falling on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle scoop, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch free for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and result in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give to the shows their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says something that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, in spite of the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies lie wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis could predict the breakouts of flu, awful species -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great sensation sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly ceased to work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of publishing in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data is coming to an end in decisions of life -- at work, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put bits and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first competing for TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data tells us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to steer our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaques or No-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
