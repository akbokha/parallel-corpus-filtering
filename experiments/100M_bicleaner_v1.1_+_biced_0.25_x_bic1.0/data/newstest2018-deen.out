Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers farm the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work @-@ carpet , which one recognizes as such .
in the large map of the map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &apos; ancient &apos; sheets , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French forces with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville removed from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original composition for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found in the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Early / Today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most impressive example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : in the Hin@@ zo@@ omen there appears a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ an@@ ium &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els today no longer substanti@@ ate farmers - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October f@@ ests in 18@@ 10 , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the original position paper one reads not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or at the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district asylum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden initiated the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for instance , the p@@ ank@@ ering of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been in operation since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um are now meeting in the grounds of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum facility , which had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will take place and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track will take place .
with the slider , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ onies has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks by the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to give special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur at the last time throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently passed law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , and the law enforcement authorities of the state that are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without acc@@ using a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to have a deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI @-@ hate report programme , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such violations at the 16th place in the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona following immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further re@@ profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac received a picture on the ground .
at the court court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U community met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments holiday home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer &apos;s bach , he described the fence @-@ fence as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot manage to profit@@ ably on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land area is for a lot of work , much has to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not conduct bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leader &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers need to be assisted at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the open @-@ air area is therefore 40 hectares which are not to be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted by half of the leader , one quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
in this way , the farmers remained 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and agricultural women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß , too , said : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible to promote the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be air@@ pper@@ y ( slope inclin@@ ation over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men Wei@@ fen@@ cing Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ air area is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have told him if he had done so .
but it took its significance , and in particular the importance it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ itated , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really right , but as he put it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is a contemporary response to Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state not only invites the old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your afflicted masses who lon@@ ged to breathe freely , and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better visible on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the US are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus and her friends who sat down to place their words on the base after their death knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female embo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classic depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative who puts the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled upon something here .
the importance of the statue is completely and even a matter of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black sha@@ kes Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle recalls a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland a special thing develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ton@@ - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
her speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British squ@@ ad .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ point runner Mu@@ ir runs along this track and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season , which included the win at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also participate in the med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the particul@@ arity of being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the preferences of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he compla@@ ined about criticism , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very a@@ dep@@ t to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to de@@ duct his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman , Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled but asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea either , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they are rather dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when people have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ tical articles and arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this issue was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters s@@ cour@@ ged on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the Club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he stuck this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the past year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
it &apos; was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; Or@@ r said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing back and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer people have died of second@@ hand smoke in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking , &quot; said head of studies Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to second@@ hand smoke per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hous@@ ings prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; are at some point in time , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , because a lot of mountains are hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the construction firm of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red traffic lights and shut @-@ off gri@@ ds is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its timber house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken out and swal@@ lowed with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many people drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included eastern parts of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated roofs , which were transformed by rust in various yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Gu@@ jar@@ ati have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Phoenix Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was mined at the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua people &apos;s resources are valued at USD 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port numbers local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in line with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Rev@@ ise Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report from the dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ u@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants originate from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ es can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua people from Papua to their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua people have changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ hang &apos;s initi@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an imp@@ etus to their sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local minister Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and killed the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building was set on fire by the nearby government commission and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting gu@@ ardi@@ ans and led the qu@@ ita dance in a circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent by an internal radio command : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; states it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been approved by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around I suddenly fired into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bear only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the State Police spokesman , Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings only happened the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the deployment of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Mr. Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been inflic@@ ted in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with fi@@ ery un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , Indonesian police fired on villa@@ gers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 year old ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured persons have been delivered quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the mobile police bri@@ gade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Papua people by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have been in large numbers since the opening of new flights to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region tend to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Papua people rarely have capital or skills required to compete in their own businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s campaign have not been realized , the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Virginia : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting ) .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited the 4th of May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ a@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to be a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place in Dubai on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units fired the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by the cla@@ dding , the exterior cla@@ dding for decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cla@@ dding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this Sport @-@ Revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup sing@@ les only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although they are often very long , but also very valued five @-@ sentence classic will remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
even not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to fill the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers take forbidden items into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft , while inad@@ vert@@ ently forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out by more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travelers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents that admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of the Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they deliberately launched banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many mistakenly deleted smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ware by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - bear the security , those who fly the most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what fluids you are allowed to take or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the bulk of fluids that are confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : order to cancel tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far failed to suggest that some of the clients have already booked their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed for the first time another , less glorious number when announ@@ cing the recent quar@@ terly balance : that of the canc@@ ell@@ ations on the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition is currently being delivered .
now Mus@@ k conce@@ des : 6@@ 3,000 have been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics always pointed out that it was only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pro@@ visions . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations acc@@ ru@@ e , ed Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 , all models will be - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are added per day .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines with maximum capacity without any major interrup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can &apos;t prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting off in flocks .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt is reti@@ ring because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he was su@@ ed from 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
this is a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay his compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulation , which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels withstand .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his u @-@ turn in O@@ zone &apos;s standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited for being accused of activist groups and others , and agreed to set up an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EP@@ O &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make sure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ it@@ tes surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ our their concern .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Rundfunk : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the word according to the document was on the tum@@ lingen mountain apart from the former parish church as well as a magnificent court , to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round .
there were also people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ dorf Freuden@@ stadt dating from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the wonderful settlement core of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval in@@ trin@@ sic church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two were crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell w@@ edges were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to pl@@ unge in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Night of 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ cast still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the assistance of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as a promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ our invite to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium in Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .

the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to conclude the ser@@ en@@ ade a det@@ our takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers highlight the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of great importance for tumours and audi@@ tors .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ ki feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was un@@ lawful .
the association argues that at the time of the permit on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as only at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a form error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted authorisation level is still illegal and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decre@@ ed the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered in the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them as an opportunity to check the matter again .
however , they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette to build four wind turbines that are 200 metres high .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the area of approximately 65 hectares .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the road remained closed for hours .
after police declar@@ ations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and retail@@ er plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend intends to sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket commodities .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local companies will be presenting their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the production weekend , so Christian King .
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
this means that the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; to the well @-@ held s@@ well together with sold Sunday , discussions with all commercial users and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes both spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals had lost sight of the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to rein@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - right up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that has spread far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said king in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thurin@@ gian cities are participating in the nation @-@ wide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local trade and make it stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment .

Tr@@ ump translated into printed tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president den@@ ounced him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern fron@@ tier of the United States , and sw@@ am to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; lu@@ dic@@ rous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b , &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump termin@@ ated the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull had said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant phone call for all day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists bring rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ oured to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver reaching the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and scrut@@ ini@@ zed the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the seat of the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a hind@@ rance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck is thrown by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience hit very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were dra@@ fted by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activist .
for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to maintain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a blanket on the body of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI records received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the loose for decades , citizens rightly say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com fell down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they got away from prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between governmental and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and had supp@@ ressed the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual post of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom wish to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of Black - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return at these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors were rehear@@ sing Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the play begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , --- he , disappear from my property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly here the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots , and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise to &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice stops at every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people swe@@ eps sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the final notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks keeps yard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is in a certain way inspir@@ ational , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the public had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its viewpoint .
I prefer a positive resume .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
there are no translations available .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I recognized for myself that it is a wrong thing for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it really is on the spot , at the focal point .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I will study the dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it can be done from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support .
for me it was just the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from the course of building engineering ?
sure , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , who each have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you always have to take care of it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pound ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which sold its share in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , announced a declaration of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ Ara@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday night happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device worn by people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be dealt with in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and particularly in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after K@@ ills
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay regulation by the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency due to the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it is showing the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the oz@@ on@@ ance - in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in order to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump will boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the impact of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and improve respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common council wants a common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a community room in the future senior residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the sales contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
although the area in the community is owned by the church community , it will still take a while , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are suspended , such a community space is not intended as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ iors just living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget is offset by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurbish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a community room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 per cent eligible .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that , in this respect , one does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ board between the legs , the observation that both saddle - which is leaning against the environment - as well as pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the tr@@ ump height and makes the construction more economical - is possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer claims this addition .
if it helps : it passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela responds to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t go so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against community participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to non @-@ wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not grant a grant , but receive a real exchange value , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the opposite .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to split the proposed resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with two opposing voices in the original program Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the landing field went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return van .
FC Bayern Munich needs to for@@ ego the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to take the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern visits the first mandatory game of the new season to Dortmund .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .
the staff@@ ing staff at the German football record champion Bavaria Munich will be getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 hrs / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B , trainers Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti should also abst@@ ain from David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
the Munich @-@ based artists Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trial games , An@@ cel@@ otti has taken the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 people , announced the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
wandering in the resin from Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this project .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase through 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible Install@@ ations in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z is planning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry comes from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star Path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star is more light than another , even though it is far more distant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also conve@@ ys in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye are clearly visible .
since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen Förder@@ verein , there is something similar to the planned star @-@ throw - the Plan@@ etary Way .
starting at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plugs degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet takes about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to face a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ loaded World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight @-@ weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight counter &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko ech@@ o@@ ed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
cli@@ mates asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound dé@@ but this year in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
when they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko believed in his generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show striking strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the start of the tyre at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain work better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result too , wouldn &apos;t the two ad@@ versaries have been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ cycle is to be further optimized .
and a gate after an off@@ shoot the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the supply chain in preparation with the supply chain than with the four chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just finished half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better to harmon@@ ise and we can &apos;t afford so many ab@@ duc@@ tions in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sit down with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Radi@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are considered an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come to the top six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Radio el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the beginning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new Results of Swedish Asyl@@ um App@@ age Review Rel@@ ated
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Direc@@ torate of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ inal@@ is verk@@ et ) started performing the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has published 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; maybe 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases which &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det under@@ took the 5@@ 81 results published , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is negli@@ gible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the road and traffic department at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April work began at the same time on all three bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has now obtained a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is an edge fastening , which is also used as an operational route .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to take place .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be eaten initially .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked .
the cost of the three brid@@ les is 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the county of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites Ron@@ dell to the poster &quot; great election campaig@@ ning clock . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top pair for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D voters , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot underneath the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forums One World and one of the leading organisers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old German potato salad which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pen of the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reported that he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked for Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there was not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pen is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good judgment of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
for more than an hour , the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is some time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cancel - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ man Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row of Has@@ lach mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classic German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo instrument of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music is combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz award winner N@@ ils W@@ ogram , blend classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring with tremendous success .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it to the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart says openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately went out bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ar ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone whom I have called .
or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was especially ri@@ dden by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven the children told me , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to express yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump announ@@ cing that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed themselves from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a Democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jub@@ ilation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would stop us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , compelling message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for lo@@ oping scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia on a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the ban@@ ishing of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have won gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF has voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia has accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress endor@@ ses the Task Force recommendations that it is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the wi@@ thered system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a speech at IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for soldiers de@@ pressed in Mali
at a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ian Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their expert &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old headquarters of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that began the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
rose @-@ branches put on the rose , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ atin &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief made the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
also Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation couldn &apos;t turn down the crash , nobody would have been able to do it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali minister of the Le@@ yen said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being paid , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife .
the Royal House on Thursday announced that .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , so she continued to be informed .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also sets off the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the principal speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately to be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were constantly flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ands instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ch@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that were two faults ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) refuses to res@@ ign .
because on Friday the parliament appe@@ aled for the dissolution of the parliament .
before that , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen justified their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , President of the CD@@ U Group , wants to recommend his faction to take them up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is essential that the day of the country adop@@ ts its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further course on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag withdraw@@ s the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally insp@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land to land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they have received immediate effect on their land mandate , which they have received over the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have consciously decided not to pron@@ ounce a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly choose the parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty trick game and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his MPs to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the S &amp; D Group in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Land@@ tag .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ous eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now assume the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the En@@ ligh@@ tener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
in the same way as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
if the residual heat content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the manufacturing enterprises are not directly responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual , there are too little controllers in the case of harvest .
is there only a lack of personnel or a coherent responsibility ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .
precisely this is why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present is of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and traffic @-@ ready foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the pan@@ de@@ mic means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ bra@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expenditure of the European football associations will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequence will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the manag@@ erial organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can surely make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of lords of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players but must be counter@@ ed by legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners res@@ igned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 is dis@@ cour@@ aged by the pres@@ idency , his successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to sc@@ are off excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , against The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat fee , it can distribute the amount for the accounting system over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros .
the first wave of pen@@ alties in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered as legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come through payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 20@@ 22 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 20@@ 22 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup is going to be Ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to keep in mind any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G through N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot@@ ics sales .
the Association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways or different interests can have if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ oter supplier
in the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Schokolade has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
now there is a close cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on demand from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate tablets divide up to 14 grams per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any details about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary produces annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract in the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
the Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before closing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
on long haul flights the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered by conf@@ ection@@ ers by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class , will also be distributing the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter rot@@ ated the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as a franchise it feels like the time is tight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids , who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win back the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering system principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That C@@ ells the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character clas@@ hes with an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , ex@@ ams are the best part of the franchise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sub @-@ lip of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random ins@@ an@@ ity that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I think as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka sets out to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( another producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to view ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ha Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Find the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often happens like a single one .
in six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ arranged on a lower length , could better deliver its agit@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been hit by the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz distributed on Friday .
in the process , 15 accused were arrested between 25 years and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian hack@@ ers were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 police officers were in action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the ma@@ fia will be accused of organised crime crime , serious crimes , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , large @-@ scale use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the investigations , Italian nationals were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang &apos;s account .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the alien @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ conduct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in a timely manner in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the Register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the Register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on sufficient tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such wrong assignments , however , led to a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to them , the paper means that BA@@ MF performs such procedures in relation to families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper had reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin deal , the EU state is responsible for refugees that they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can return it to the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with children under age in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees to the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left wing in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening human rights conditions due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community hon@@ ors the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a donation of blood .
at the same time , corn co@@ ach@@ ers reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ pf@@ en@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DRC round@@ table leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , a few years ago , the shift to the theatre has lead to higher number of participants .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rah were among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 blood donations each .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates up to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby fewer members were striving to increase the rate of interest because weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years in order to raise the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut business package published a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial funds for banks from the coming February , although it is said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billions of pounds ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households remains bur@@ dened with consumption . &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expect .
markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank declared that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s down@@ gra@@ ined growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of housing , as the sharpen@@ ing first becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the spark .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that it was expected to be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and seeking to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run the existing deals and fin@@ alise the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now provided by the Health Service for a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV transmission significantly .
pre@@ p prior to having intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics we identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted on needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to alter the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this study brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to lay the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to let it work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important that when you push the door , it &apos;s very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electric outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate empire in the value of more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the Brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the West@@ co Jeans founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - has about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul about a third .
a court record says that Col@@ in owns property worth 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed mi@@ tigation .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled him out .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian legacy calls for the family to be the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ acy in the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ an@@ lade of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West co there when he was &quot; in my last years the High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept herself back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media made contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports , hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president .
Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Brother Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ ump@@ et t@@ witter custom under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaig@@ ners there is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady praise price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that s@@ ling@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ witter custom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that twe@@ ets and twe@@ ets without their intervention would have included even more fuel .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his collabor@@ ators have done it several times to keep away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House sit down from competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the love of the advis@@ ers to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings like a volcano , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens to find out where they come from .
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody canc@@ eled a printed copy of an article from Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly takes three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump still is his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his couns@@ ell@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable facts make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , some references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol on Friday reported on the action followed by the Winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting vacation destinations were hiding , was called Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ script has been viewed for more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online fak@@ es could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the Internet site .
travellers bar@@ gain over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are standing with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans , after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous user said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame for implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , moved forward and are back now .
more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council cannot stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an indigenous who didn &apos;t want to be mentioned said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country side of Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente &quot; Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH &quot; on 13 April 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost one year and also revenue from the local tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees entering the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collection accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all the mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , mayor of Freuden@@ stadt , defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with head office Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been built for a long time in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty citizen @-@ close &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer points out .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly the amount of investments .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external installations are also placed on the front@@ man , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee took the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
CN@@ N reported that there were already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s elder son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time trying to intervene specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , acting as advis@@ ers to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more tr@@ umps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Agent Tr@@ ump personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the president may have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to raise charges .
the Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Indi@@ ct@@ ments .
most of the time they are turned on when they are bigger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the board can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to charge persons for interro@@ gation under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ invitations were already issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former campaign boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort participated in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the suspension showed that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
however , the introduction of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special educ@@ ator in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it won &apos;t be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , so it was stated in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this cat@@ chy , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to susp@@ end the investigation against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special educ@@ ator and his collabor@@ ators .
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday that the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in West Antar@@ c@@ tica , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research dealt with it on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north@@ wards and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to human beings .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers this could be related to global warming .
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
ice @-@ ice flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and interrup@@ tions some years ago .
a complete ice shelf will be broken down there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the anterior edge has never withdrawn as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece break at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes about the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection with climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is debat@@ able whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back again or fall short @-@ term and possibly collap@@ ses , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these explor@@ ers do not lead to the aband@@ on@@ ment of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , there have been a lot of ice @-@ s@@ nu@@ kes in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long strip of Antar@@ c@@ tica is stretching towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Survey has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and therefore counts in areas where the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration broke through .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day .
the teaching positions of the circle are obviously very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
however , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places by the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management is to work out a concept for personnel development and personnel development according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages , it is said .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age due to their age .
so high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Brenn@@ an , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had already taken care of a big surprise already in the Krei@@ sau day , when he publicly challenged the staff@@ ing costs and star@@ tled the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the circular administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - should aim for a house @-@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the CD@@ U better to pay the employees and officials better than the tari@@ ff bill for the public service actually envis@@ ages .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is geared towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established , in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new constitution protection law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who deploy rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew will take ding@@ h@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s action , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard who monitors the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about any &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures had declined in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan may@@ ors in this month about economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
climbs and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin Ou@@ ter post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in der Nord@@ pf@@ alz for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always longer climbs , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out spot looked at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges provided welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed the healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga matches for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
the fact is : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scores included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Board President Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that many clubs are going to asc@@ end on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online than sending the federal flag to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just football simulation FIFA are being fought at a competition level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself , in which the pros are competing against each other .
and in the Asian Games 20@@ 22 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport in general ?
for many , the performance is surely getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ l has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , we need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were hard to carry out on online games , and the structures of classical sports were missing in the scene .
the scientist highlighted the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive amusement software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth ahead of e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , revenue is expected to be at 130 million .
this is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the agenda .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , a lot is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , F@@ rob@@ atic says .
in the Netherlands and France , the German football associations , according to D@@ utt , are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares V@@ f@@ B board member R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align it to the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that only when football is all the way it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poison @-@ eggs - the egg @-@ alternatives for cooking and baking
in the meantime , nearly all federal states have been affected by the scandal over toxic eggs .
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and all the eggs are taken from the sale in Germany .
in regi@@ ments , only eggs should be taken that do not contain any fi@@ pron@@ il .
Michelle Carter convic@@ ted of the texts of Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for Conrad Roy &apos;s negli@@ gent execution , which took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she was faced with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward turned eyes , when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day at which I am not consuming the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I am with everything else . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer having this single person with which I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call upon another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ worker in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of Bayern Munich
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
FC Bavaria dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ i instantly , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the binding binding on his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first bet as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Nap@@ les .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign from the coach as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially on holiday .
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of herbs that can be kept in a good mood .
those who were chosen to take the inheritance from Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ r@@ ted as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .
and in general , Kim@@ i was working in this initial formation , like the one who can take the helm at the very best .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ recorded tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal now tries to exagger@@ ate his missing fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che succ@@ eeds in connecting to the devil come out of the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( also only partly conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le won &apos;t be neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
in addition Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the Ar@@ med Forces , got off and both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times successfully in building up the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance when he made his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shifting , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game afterwards .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said good @-@ bye to some cr@@ un@@ chy statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game at Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft pra@@ ises Wis@@ cour@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V on a change in economic policy - and simultaneously add the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees natural in infrastructure policy : the gap closure of the 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry hopes for a planning process this year , until 2021 is expected to be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the German traffic road@@ map .
the goal is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says ministry spokesperson Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) of Trier , as by Wis@@ sing , aims at promoting a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label in the wine to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wishing to establish their own company , the I@@ HK wins .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1,000 euros is planned for the passed Master &apos;s examination and 2500 euros , if graduates do their own independently within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
up to now 29 locations have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce demands more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U res@@ ig@@ ns on the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in the receipt of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sober@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK questionnaire with a rating of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Economy Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer updating the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ted by diesel engines are carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , installing systems for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles , also take into account what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having concealed the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the Lau@@ ghter Against Su@@ ff@@ ering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself as dra@@ fts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , its cute figures continue to be widely spread around the world .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main figure in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ fold as a counterpart .
his figures are for the first time in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why it is more likely to rely on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is reproduced without wor@@ shipping .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is shr@@ inking due to the conditions of dro@@ ught , and due to the diseases transmitted insects , which causes great headache to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf @-@ ti@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration out of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet with Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 .
among the latter are her editor and inspiration from R@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the sc@@ allo@@ p building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of Mor@@ den , who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at R@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor .
without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated by &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of R@@ odo@@ ce , has broken the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival Cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed members of the gang bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ sts when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of the odo@@ ce and sold 50 USD hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without b@@ umping on the drug d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of the country , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to Protect Journ@@ alists for their courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the odo@@ ce @-@ team is missing Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n who was able to curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells of wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of the odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activist in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the Gover@@ nor designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where the drugs gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , R@@ odo@@ ce has stuck to three major stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that carried out a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter ran out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who had listened to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political planes almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organised protests on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill because they said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , the government officials involved and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to her separate head .
some branches chose to include the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do what El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly opposed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page entitled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still monitor the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 .
for those who want to stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ fl@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of Kar@@ tell messages in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of the odo@@ ur@@ less mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the following day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ aped up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid they didn &apos;t show it .
under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the cow@@ or@@ kers followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ orn of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the per@@ v@@ asive , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of noc@@ turn@@ al din@@ osau@@ rs , living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready now to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ king just a little , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably has been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by eating din@@ osau@@ rs with sufficient pressure that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his con@@ served dar@@ ede@@ vil to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this noc@@ turn@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you look just a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the reserved avi@@ d din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house @-@ branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a lot@@ to &apos; gain .
the more I look , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Expansion on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass grave collision .
there are numerous injured , miles long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
after the first data of the police , between the junction between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were cra@@ cked together .
at first , no information is available about the exact number of publishers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ stage was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also came to massive disabilities on the counter @-@ track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted down the number plates of the vehicle hand@@ lers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the cost @-@ free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at many other long haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket depreci@@ ation without she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get on the train , call out his ticket in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button on the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seating area Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at ticket inspection at the Y place , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ d@@ ants simply check in the DB Navig@@ ator themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB communications board member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections belong to the biggest off@@ ences .
for many times , however , one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ de@@ es and passengers , leading to bad tuning in the compartment or large space and delays in control of one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ ler @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to her and her community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets in the evening about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police and people shou@@ ting , and from a man claiming to be the father of Brown who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his gun and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she picked up her father &apos;s 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ uson next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting at 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who had a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; about the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a peak of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only do activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give it a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place in front of the Police Direc@@ torate , who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating fair@@ ness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ uson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former Co @-@ Director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death row prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ of Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we constantly fight on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , news cameras have long gone missing in F@@ erg@@ uson , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people , although it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone sp@@ li@@ ts the population in advoc@@ ates and ad@@ versaries since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme can hardly be cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
on top of that : the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded .
the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s ei for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall res@@ ett@@ les in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what was the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our town .
you can see how many shops are empty , some for months and years .
but since there is not yet another weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall be built during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already make it possible to distribute all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer a place .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ yards and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st ban@@ ished a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publicly funded diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ national and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose conviction was tran@@ sm@@ uted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created the DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison the picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined black @-@ and @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , where Mann@@ ing was obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a platinum @-@ blonde wig - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just off the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste in order to produce an image of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal e@@ ye@@ witnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic book illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president of Chelsea would transform the judgement and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts that he should correct .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ome of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how astonishing similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of the discipline in the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they dic@@ tate your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
North@@ western University professor and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide kidn@@ apping is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee from Oxford University who are sought as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County indicate .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago tells that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the incident , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police were actively searching for the two susp@@ ects said officials .
she has been professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been certified and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal investigation conducted by the relevant authorities and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way they can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insisted on susp@@ ecting the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious hint that said that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything was implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
talking to the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the Start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there never was consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers permit to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low delivery results - so that you can drill out why .
companies are coming to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 , according to the German Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
how G@@ LIN@@ T enables Con@@ ver@@ cent companies to send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion condem@@ ns regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ts , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has deployed Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to trace the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take on ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting company collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry played online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
scent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ tering won $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is an increasing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hears their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company don &apos;t take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointments can grow and employees will dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not follow , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better relationship of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ises
it is about 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas on the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return after the three hour exercise to their final audi@@ ts before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons passed in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if she added another point to the gam@@ ers &apos; busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they get off , they &apos;re great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the neighbouring Fun@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already cleared a protective net behind a gate post .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set off to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;

Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fak@@ ers and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible false statements and to send them to factor checks , which may display results of the factor test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they do not succeed in eliminating hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts is started in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories from the third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cosy seat in the Wat@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully .
&quot; what a personal relationship , to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ri@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb@@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) it seems to be too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the era of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Pe@@ as@@ ant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant revolt started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , who hidden the family Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century depic@@ t his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his efforts in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ oped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f commen@@ ced its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August , it is said to be the highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the chapel at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her yesterday free website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is in competition with other local authorities .
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f costs an average five @-@ digit amount due to its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension schemes and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the consultations .
this led to the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were set off .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the crash test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed itself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ out ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale training with the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered more 7@@ 3@@ 95 servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to go earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they were calling on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least with appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically pushing forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly not@@ orious officer seeking asylum from persecution in foreign countries sought asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this applies , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness to deploy the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fores@@ ees to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will be spent on Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate route for the ski lift
over the past few months the future of the race track sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated road that drives the tourist train .
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabili@@ tate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Transport Minister Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country takes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle shall also be ordered from the country in the future , is now finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators agree on the technical details already .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle was to be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested whether the track is being used by many people to order them regul@@ arily again in the future .
in addition , the route is highly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey during the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; custom@@ ize &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and choose anything from the robot &apos;s eye colour over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ators have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities , such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in a mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , be@@ wil@@ dered a most .
on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to some Dun@@ lop and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots arise in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most frigh@@ tening aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid ) is not the graphic pictures , the ent@@ win@@ ed bodies and the daughter &apos;s eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ary or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the language of 2017 : maid service

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of humanity
it has become a pl@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relative .
we all re@@ port@@ edly urge all of us to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of pumps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long engaged in the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and stran@@ gely on the same page .
to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the stell@@ ar effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer be thrown away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right W@@ ing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy , in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ing music medi@@ ates this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar enough to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the central park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ inning , while I tired of the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first slaughter .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , from which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ att@@ lers from F@@ itz@@ ingen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eag@@ les to grow up in the hen yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in chickens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to er@@ brü@@ ten it from its chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain .
afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders bore to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination was to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ att@@ ler that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a thank @-@ word to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps in with teaching g@@ asses , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the Trag@@ zeit is now over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she was very reluct@@ ant to leave her students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the fourth @-@ wat@@ chers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to conclude , all students ended up with a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy erup@@ ted with the children .
eight first @-@ clim@@ bers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulgarian nationals were detained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced , quoted by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp@@ ed people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
the aim is to improve the exhaust behavior of Euro 5 emissions allow@@ ances and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe offers assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates sold are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced quick implementation over the next few months , but have not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each person concerned .
if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its context .
how long will the retro@@ fits slip altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily when it comes to the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE is waiting for you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
so far , there has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lad ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors this year .
the prizes will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , had already announced that he would wai@@ ve participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - to ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she would use Tr@@ ump to make clear of her view .
Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s City Buil@@ der , reti@@ res next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ mer has been a mayor since 31 years .
and the work always makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has submitted the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus - taking into account the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as a Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate degrees .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they couldn &apos;t fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about good working climate and good atmosphere between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , looking back at the wh@@ ack with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen par@@ cours around the world are met .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will hit some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a great le@@ e@@ way for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted in a flexible way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the landsc@@ aping of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Old Town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes .
in any case , the City Buil@@ der bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor too long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should have a degree in degree in architecture and construction planning according to the city of Has@@ lach .
the municipal building department accommod@@ ates civil engineering , civil engineering , urban planning , urban planning , municipal building yard with building yard and municipal gardening , as well as the Lower building law office , including heritage protection .
thrown bike on lines : closed on the South Rail@@ road
according to the police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a red sco@@ oter and a bike rider were watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator would have brought himself to great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delays and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s railway customers could also get to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum could be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South Rail@@ road could be managed without obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten people had lost Friday morning , two of them involved in the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food are not penet@@ rating the body .
cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their diet , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movements if the same system is also involved in people .
post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which , however , was kept separate , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice lining , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ a@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
matic , however , was excluded from the pre @-@ release Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u were also star@@ ing at the Avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US airplane manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in USA Mich@@ igan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind sp@@ ins : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD boss , social @-@ demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
only not a distur@@ b@@ ance from the party centre , but not a head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important desire of the election fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were set@@ backs .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the Green Federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the choice of voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President and campaign manager of the Green Party in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ gh , as on Friday morning the new hi@@ bis@@ se message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the tak@@ eover of Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
that &apos;s what it was - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the ca@@ vern , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ pp@@ elling in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication then what could be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time already .
giant survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , because over the past weeks , Weil am trying to make a stronger focus in the federal government .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
because of this , because of the party internal force of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , there is no guilt .
and Schulz did not at all .
at the same time , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen presents her own career in the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary fraction , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to parliament on account of her person as a direct candidate , but by the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SD@@ P into the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ member distorted the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
subsi@@ dy funds for local people III
those who want to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated in the years can receive support from the country in the near future .
on Wednesday , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development said in emotion .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what was happening so far .
since 1991 , there have been sensi@@ tis@@ ation areas .
at the time , in the refurbish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the re@@ development area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous restructuring is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only to develop new construction sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 4 April , I received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a modernis@@ ation area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest from the community felt .
how is a refurbish@@ ment area now being developed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , according to Sch@@ ind@@ ler , continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then shift again .
on Wednesday evening the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellars presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is per site .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey will only be carried out once , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December , the course deadline is to take place , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can start in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the above @-@ mentioned preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when it is being rehabili@@ t@@ ated and what extent .
it will then also be registered in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that a significant factor of success for the project was the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it deals with the structural condition and the refurbish@@ ment views , among other things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and apartment arch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for subsidies .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the funding is based on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who comes first comes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to get to house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory practitioner in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built @-@ in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars according to the military information provided to the TI@@ ME magazine .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American chess programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a yacht in Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy naval commander of aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 : 00 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew was required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original air@@ crew was at the helicopter while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records made available to the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second air crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and advoc@@ ated con@@ tainment of government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous reasons .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the White House press secretary , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirement of the air@@ crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew additional 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the load for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential par@@ ting , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense &apos;s tari@@ ffs for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
record of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract termination .
at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s commitment to the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that will be produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump interven@@ ed with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
runner @-@ up of the Second World Tennis Championships in Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V takes place .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ League has maintained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay is in any case respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law for tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors have been troubled by domestic O@@ MV , which is co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies to build the Russian East Sou@@ thwest Service Nord Stream 2 .
the threat of dr@@ one is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .

scroll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld will again take over food supplies in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ie , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooking will continue to be cooked : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooked vegetables .
the city operates 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 : 00 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from 1 September onwards : they warm up the delivered dishes , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , leave the meal out , leave , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides over the hour circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen staff now firmly belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self @-@ control and external distribution for the city .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ dance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are going to nom@@ inate during the elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly prestigious and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have released threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will pass the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make a commitment to the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow against managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ gate location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products makes Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s managing director , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insisted on &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot provide clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of T@@ oll@@ house received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with collabor@@ ators and G@@ MB representatives on T@@ oll@@ o@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ house as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may be of interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always done his best to take care of him since San@@ tos arrived in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club putting interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report weighs on Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse falls is reli@@ eved of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse scandal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , Spe@@ aker of the Reform Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the case of reporting on violence the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Heights was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
regarding the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis was also saying : &quot; you love to go to church and that &apos;s a dev@@ our@@ able fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse falls , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
according to author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg to inform him ?
between 1945 and the early 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; were sexually ab@@ used with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over @-@ access , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be more intense .
nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims inv@@ ade the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories bind with it . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Heights is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of exercise of violence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students stand out for their &quot; hum@@ ann@@ ess . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears to be a ch@@ ol@@ ery and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has become pal@@ p@@ able when a cathedral sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
at best it can be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough .
the domain gym@@ nasi@@ um in which he worked was felt by virtually all those surve@@ yed - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger students also express an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; was always sour@@ ced from grapes grown by children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to the outbreak of rage .
the fact that he was not only popping up with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor , but also having ears distributed and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able times , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is certainly dre@@ ad@@ ful .
one wonders if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just r@@ ushed on him .
on the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
the truth , however , is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , there was much talk about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity regarding sexual abuse in the final report ?
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the master kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a afflicted representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even concern themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director who , in a certain degree , would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the cat @-@ and @-@ cat student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse falls ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of the people of all things have opened themselves more urgently or more clearly or more , than with their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students and / or their surroundings confi@@ ded in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display .
therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these atro@@ cious crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge thr@@ ong of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a separate separation : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the dome @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence @-@ eating as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were brut@@ ally har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , and suffered terri@@ bly , took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first when they were already at the domain gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories connect with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the repro@@ ach remains to be looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported about the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only about 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Gramm@@ ar School , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty is still practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommended urgent intervention in the face of the danger of negative press releases .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they occ@@ ured in a legal grey zone , as each one of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .

it was only in 1980 that the punishment was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that in the past .
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , thus creating ear @-@ arrows and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg &apos;s time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ fer &apos;s sentence also be found in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective , that the dome cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not conc@@ ede that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would probably not have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and can@@ dies alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys will not once again stand a great singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : through the work on the book and beyond , I got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , ground@@ less , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything else just a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen works today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen hosts are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ability , to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published will relieve him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the An@@ archy area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
