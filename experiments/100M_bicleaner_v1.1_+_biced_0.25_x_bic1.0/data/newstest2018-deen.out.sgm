<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers farm the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich-based Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork-carpet, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large map of the map, more detailed maps, so-called 'ancient' sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French forces with the peace of Lunéville removed from February 9, 1801, they were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found in the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the comparison" "" "Early / Today" "" "is the most impressive example of the state capital." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: in the Hinzoomen there appears a smaller-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "uranium" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small parcels today no longer substantiate farmers - but small farmers of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the October fests in 1810, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the original position paper one reads not only the street names" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or at the height" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen - but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße there were once people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district asylum" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the establishment - that psychiatrist, associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for instance, the pankering of so-called" "" "madmen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been in operation since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesanum are now meeting in the grounds of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum facility, which had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days will take place and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colonies has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to come into force by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to give special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur at the last time throughout the state and be noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, and the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without accusing a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by Missouri's Office of Attorney General in which it is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to have a deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI-hate report programme, which classifies the state regarding the number of such violations at the 16th place in the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona following immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further reprofiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac received a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the court court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherman's CDU community met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments holiday home.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischer's bach, he described the fence-fence as" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot manage to profitably on such steep areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area is for a lot of work, much has to be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the" "" "Leader" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers need to be assisted at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their business," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-air area is therefore 40 hectares which are not to be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted by half of the leader, one quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and agricultural women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß, too, said: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible to promote the state-of-the-art fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be airppery (slope inclination over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen Weifencing Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitters would have told him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the importance it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta imitated, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really right, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is a contemporary response to Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state not only invites the old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your afflicted masses who longed to breathe freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was better visible on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the US are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who sat down to place their words on the base after their death knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls anyone but rather an early neo-conservative who puts the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh has stumbled upon something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is completely and even a matter of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black shakes Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship leader" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Button- who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Schotten are in the British squad.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midpoint runner Muir runs along this track and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included the win at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also participate in the medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the particularity of being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the preferences of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He complained about criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to deduct his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled but asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the comments section of the news show" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, they are rather disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor designated as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when people have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cortical articles and arrest or arrest demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters scourged on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>

<seg id="435">Those who order a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines with maximum capacity without any major interruptions.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">This is a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for Ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay his compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulation, which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels withstand.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his u-turn in Ozone's standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited for being accused of activist groups and others, and agreed to set up an appointment for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority we give to us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "however, the EPO's opinion that Pruitt will eventually use his" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "will make sure that the rules" "" "are based on solid policies and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York general prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "the conversion of EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "said Schneiderman." ""</seg>
<seg id="459">New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="460">Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="461">The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and every year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths.</seg>
<seg id="462">Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruittes surprising course changes.</seg>
<seg id="463">"" "" "" "it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhale," "" "said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity." ""</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promoters of Tumour their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuschapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Rundfunk: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The word according to the document was on the tumlingen mountain apart from the former parish church as well as a magnificent court, to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberdorf Freudenstadt dating from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the wonderful settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval intrinsic church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two were crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell wedges were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to plunge in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Night of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-cast still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the assistance of Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As a promoter, the friends and promoters of Tumour invite to the sixth serenade on Sunday, 16th July, on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium in Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade a detour takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers highlight the fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of great importance for tumours and auditors.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlinki feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "does not foresee a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">She was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of the permit on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as only at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the city border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent a" "" "recess" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a form error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted authorisation level is still illegal and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, chairman of" "" "Boisheim refuses" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decreed the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "with this, the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "the corresponding letters have been entered in the district of Viersen since last week," "" "declared a spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them as an opportunity to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area on the Boisheimer Nette to build four wind turbines that are 200 metres high.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the area of approximately 65 hectares.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the power requirement of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg, in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="759">The proposal foresees to signal the investor that, in this respect, one does not want to throw a billboard between the legs, the observation that both saddle - which is leaning against the environment - as well as pulpit roof - which reduces the trump height and makes the construction more economical - is possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer claims this addition.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A seven-tonne concrete part was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of the road and traffic department at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with a red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning has now obtained a 1.30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operational route.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be eaten initially.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach town entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure of the European football associations will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequence will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the managerial organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair-play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of lords of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players but must be countered by legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners resigned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - become a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 is discouraged by the presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to scare off excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat fee, it can distribute the amount for the accounting system over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years amounting to 44,4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of penalties in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar's World Cup is going to be Ambassador and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to keep in mind any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG through Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricotics sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The Association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and they tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era.</seg>

<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the watering system principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90-" s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Cells the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character clashes with an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy-vicious Plot, in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As usual, exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sub-lip of "Singles" whose former big-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random insanity that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I think as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka sets out to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (another producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloha Sevigny - ensures a decent play 'Find the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often happens like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank manager with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne closet space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel plant is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored in order to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's very important that when you push the door, it's very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electric outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of Victorias's biggest real estate empire in the value of more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the Brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco Jeans founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the De LUTIS portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - has about two thirds of the company's wealth and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record says that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the opinions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian legacy calls for the family to be the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first Jeanlade of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started West co there when he was "in my last years the High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claims that mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>

<seg id="1388">A new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports, hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumpet White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Brother Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from jobs that were convincing," "" "said former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumpet twitter custom under control, according to six ex-election campaigners there is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady praise price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that slingo" "" "twitter custom" "" "was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that tweets and tweets without their intervention would have included even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have done it several times to keep away from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House sit down from competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the love of the advisers to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press clippings like a volcano, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he stiffens to find out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody canceled a printed copy of an article from Gotnews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly takes three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still is his impulsive self, and his counsellors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable facts make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente "Betriebsgesellschaft mbH" on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost one year and also revenue from the local tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees entering the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all the mayor Julian Osswald, mayor of Freudenstadt, defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with head office Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The former Hotel Birkenhof has been built for a long time in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should later become" "" "pretty citizen-close" "", "as Thomas Scherer is expressing himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer points out.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he has already led, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly the amount of investments.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he calculates.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external installations are also placed on the frontman, which is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee took the work over the past few weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to persons familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there were already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumpur's elder son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin for a long time trying to intervene specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, acting as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Agent Trump personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation whether the president may have impeded the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">The Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when they are bigger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, pre-invitations were already issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., also Trump Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign boss Paul Manafort participated in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the suspension showed that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the introduction of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the democrats a chance to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerated the work of the special educator in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it won't be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, so it was stated in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this catchy, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wants to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to suspend the investigation against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special educator and his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of Congress, such as the Watergate affair about the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice-ice floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxes and interruptions some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf will be broken down there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the anterior edge has never withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece break at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes about the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks up regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection with climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is debatable whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back again or fall short-term and possibly collapses, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these explorers do not lead to the abandonment of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, there have been a lot of ice-snukes in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long strip of Antarctica is stretching towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Survey has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and therefore counts in areas where the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU asks to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new places in the administration broke through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions of the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 unoccupied places by the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the management is to work out a concept for personnel development and personnel development according to the" "" "parties" "" "desire." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and involve a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a regular" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Brennan, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had already taken care of a big surprise already in the Kreisau day, when he publicly challenged the staffing costs and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the circular administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-related cities - should aim for a house-tariff," "" "states nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">This makes the CDU better to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff bill for the public service actually envisages.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is geared towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established, in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new constitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who deploy rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew will take dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's action, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coastguard who monitors the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about any "major changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel prize laureate organisation is without borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures had declined in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors in this month about economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Climbs and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Outer post" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in der Nordpfalz for four days to enjoy Trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- und wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be more often present on these markets online than sending the federal flag to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or just football simulation FIFA are being fought at a competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself, in which the pros are competing against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport in general?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is surely getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobl has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, we need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested himself as draftsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is shrinking due to the conditions of drought, and due to the diseases transmitted insects, which causes great headache to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarf-tides, and in very dry weather there are very many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper riodoce usually meet with Wednesdays to check their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are her editor and inspiration from Rodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the scallop building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Attorney General was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of Morden, who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Rodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated by "Twelfth Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rodoce, has broken the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival Cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed members of the gang bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for norosts when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of the odoce and sold 50 USD holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without bumping on the drug dowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the founding of the country, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" "" "for its coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee to Protect Journalists for their courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I do not want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many dead? why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The odoce-team is missing Valdez, the spawn who was able to curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells of wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the odoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of the odoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before, it became known that Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activist in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the Governor designated as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drugs gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Rodoce has stuck to three major stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures, which concentrated on Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter ran out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who had listened to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political planes almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military raid." ""</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" in organised protests on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-classified by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, the government officials involved and an indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nocturnal dinosaurs, living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well-preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth-clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is ready now to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blinking just a little, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa der Dinosaurier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably has been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mingle better in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta Markchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shaded is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs were hunted by eating dinosaurs with sufficient pressure that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the Cretaceous Age," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs were hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved avid dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a mail from someone from high school.</seg>

<seg id="2031">"" "there were photos of police and people shouting, and from a man claiming to be the father of Brown who wore a sign with the inscription:" "" "Fergusons police killed my unarmed son!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed, where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock, she picked up her father's 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting at 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who had a flower-dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give it a bad service to keep them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place in front of the Police Directorate, who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism completely changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating fairness and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came to Ferrell in the sense:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">"" "Folayan already collaborated with the former Co-Director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row prisoners." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents from" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayof Martin in 2012 marked the film" "" "Blacklive Matter" "" "in social media, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we constantly fight on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "at which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no accident, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, news cameras have long gone missing in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population in advocates and adversaries since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme can hardly be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">On top of that: the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty, some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not yet another weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall be built during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no longer a place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupyards and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst banished a 35-year prison sentence after publicly funded diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transnational and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transmuted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created the DNA extracted from maning and created out of the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison the picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained black-and-white Selfie, where Manning was obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just off the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette buttocks and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste in order to produce an image of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal eyewitnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president of Chelsea would transform the judgement and it would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits that he should correct.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandome of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishing similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the discipline in the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they dictate your speech, they have won," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who greets Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacons, which assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"" "" "" "in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits." ""</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's schedule to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the replacement of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything was implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has got an error." ""</seg>

<seg id="2203">The Start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers permit to circumvent the C-Suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, Co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low delivery results - so that you can drill out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion worth by 2020, according to the German Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Scent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">How GLINT enables Convercent companies to send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "public opinion condemns regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has deployed Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to trace the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states have been hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who manages the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take on ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting company collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry played online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Scent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering won $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is an increasing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that hears their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company don't take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, disappointments can grow and employees will demotivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "if you do not follow, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported on GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better relationship of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Watl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship, to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Riiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumbprint!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">"" "Oh, I love archives!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overrated my welcome-greeting") it seems to be too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with patrons, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it in the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the era of English Empires, cards that represent what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are interconnected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, who hidden the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century depict his own funeral by filling a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pension schemes and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>

<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wirepuller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the lifting of the headscout ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale training with the army and the security forces continues.</seg>

<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing shuttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will begin this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"" "" "" "with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this particularly important connection," "" "stated Transport Minister Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country takes 75 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even crazier in 2017, a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey during the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "customize" his robot according to his convictions and choose anything from the robot's eye colour over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuators have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities, such as Frigid Farrah, who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as much as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in a mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, bewildered a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, true Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to some Dunlop and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots arise in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most frightening aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid) is not the graphic pictures, the entwined bodies and the daughter's eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities" the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediary or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the language of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Helpful hints about our website?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of humanity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a plump-wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly urge all of us to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of pumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long engaged in the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the stellar effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his bibs will no longer be thrown away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the Right Wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urgical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy, in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perspiring music mediates this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar enough to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The central park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-ies can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning, while I tired of the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumer has been a mayor since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work always makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that so far no application has submitted the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - taking into account the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administration community as a Lower Building Law Authority, the applicant must instruct appropriate degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food are not penetrating the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements if the same system is also involved in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, was kept separate, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice lining, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On 4 April, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a modernisation area III.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a yacht in Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the deputy naval commander of aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7am on the South Lawn for the event at 3: 00 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew was required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original aircrew was at the helicopter while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records made available to the TIME, it was not clear whether a second air crew was ultimately required.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse falls is relieved of Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "the final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, Speaker of the Reform Movement "We are Church," declared an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the case of reporting on violence the Domspatzen Heights was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a quite normal pedagogical means" "" "was to be done with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse falls, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">According to author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "said Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg to inform him?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 "Regensburger Domspatzen" were sexually abused with high plausibility "victims of over-access, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by the Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims invade the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories bind with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Heights is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of exercise of violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students stand out for their "humanness."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears to be a cholery and perfectionist who has become palpable when a cathedral spatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it can be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domain gymnasium in which he worked was felt by virtually all those surveyed - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of Georg Ratzinger students also express an excellent testimony, described him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "was always sourced from grapes grown by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to the outbreak of rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he was not only popping up with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor, but also having ears distributed and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable times, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, it is certainly dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth, however, is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, there was much talk about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen).</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger accused of any involvement or complicity regarding sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the master kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said a afflicted representative for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even concern themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director who, in a certain degree, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cat-and-cat student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse falls?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the offenders." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that all of the people of all things have opened themselves more urgently or more clearly or more, than with their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>

<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display.</seg>

<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much of" "" "nonviolence" "" "to read among the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge throng of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a separate separation: between the pre-school and the high school of the dome-cats, between sexual abuse and violence-eating as well as, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral-sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were brutally harassed and maligned, and suffered terribly, took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first when they were already at the domain gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiac" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R." "", "and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories connect with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the reproach remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported about the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from his predecessors at a school where he did not work and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then only about 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Grammar School, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the pre-school the test penalty is still practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">He recommended urgent intervention in the face of the danger of negative press releases.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occured in a legal grey zone, as each one of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the punishment was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>

<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, thus creating ear-arrows and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he was strictly adhered to.</seg>

<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüfer's sentence also be found in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, that the dome cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not concede that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would probably not have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candies alone, the unruly boys will not once again stand a great singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzinger: through the work on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, groundless, deep-believing and heart-good people, of which one can't imagine that he could do anything else just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen works today, 23 years after his emerization, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen hosts are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectability, to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "for the report that has just been published will relieve him." ""</seg>
