Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not have to be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the latest &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of her TV with delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , they ask the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run on our 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sport pyramid
his experiences on horseback are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid of sport &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lop .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he had his family run over the system of the AL@@ RV , he didn &apos;t even swear by a horse for taking photographs .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Py@@ ramid of Sports .
there is no lack of hon@@ ours to the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already pla@@ gu@@ ed him .
the 18th prize winner of the pyramid of sport is a long one .
in Aachen he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering the young generation for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drawings include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder of Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the young@@ ster Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the la@@ ven@@ der price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Hel@@ per Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical .
who , about the role of the state .
in doubt , Tr@@ ump seeks to keep them small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive regulations massi@@ vely and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in that it must be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost immediately .
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment schemes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty @-@ W@@ ing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , some party @-@ internal discussions could come up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re@@ charge coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in protected areas , which aims to termin@@ ate the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will be the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transp@@ onder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but rather only to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ att@@ led , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps .
on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics think that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ eing woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers shelter .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each baby has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her small son in his arm .
he looked inqu@@ isi@@ tively into the room with great eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social relief services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central accommodation for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as the hope for Europe , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons are out@@ weigh@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that as soon as they come to Germany , Irish , B@@ ahr re@@ counts .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Regi@@ stra@@ ints are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether or not they know about a similar project like in Munich , some say no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not separated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be shel@@ tered separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or are housed men and women together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
as much as the women feel this need for protection , one can read the urge to read it on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new working conditions
representatives of the param@@ edi@@ cs have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour disputes from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; have had problems , leading to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re @-@ negotiations about all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour disputes that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in assistance specialists attending six times this year , the first general cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before voting by 5@@ 4,000 Assistant Doc@@ tors and Medical Stu@@ dents before the agreement was to be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey came together on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ row@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been any worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to suggest that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that the head of state had forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory speeches : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the going was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria territory controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late season ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West since it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge over the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this g@@ lit@@ tering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; in Russia and Turkey : two countries that have driven away from the West and feel badly treated and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the common reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents expressed their opinion at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
Turkey &apos;s president avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Management Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be nearly collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and the exchange listing of Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be totally different in their own communities and our employees will work with our customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that brands would have launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori ob@@ serves the jub@@ ilation , when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have already taken 6000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !

Russian Putin hum@@ idi@@ fies Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the tigh@@ test of confidence in Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special commission@@ er for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is stated that Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy for 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later served as the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked me to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s stric@@ test confidence and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will reti@@ re at his own request .
but despite the smile of the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again want to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say to me this very complicated item - you could almost say to entr@@ ust for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , President of Russia could become President of Russia , as a third term had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin &apos;s coup , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .

ri@@ ddle around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals , which were sp@@ las@@ hed by a fountain of water .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure is forward @-@ looking high @-@ end and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore .
this was accomplished by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approx . 6.000 tons and had to be moved upwards in an ascent of about 3 % .
delicate , because the toler@@ ances that the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck by 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty floating in safety while their boat moved away from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue station &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a stop@@ over , but it loos@@ ened when the boat was cre@@ ased by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic be@@ holder cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetrators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother down .
she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old moved his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who can build cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in future , investors should take much stronger responsibility .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 homes in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Action Plan Living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must now have 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left still wants to be tough@@ er for investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite this , according to Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is imminent .
if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ of @-@ date ties from the city .
in addition , we would have to think about bringing apartments back into price .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the west city the year @-@ end dead@@ lines exp@@ ire .
some 1800 apartments could be brought back to price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dras@@ tically , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can &apos;t be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
the aim of Pok@@ em@@ on Go is to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created from it ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , has recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; to &quot; come out of the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also m@@ owing cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though smartphones apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to track down our activity , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time .
but because of the success of Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; ur@@ ns

dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast called for a multi @-@ stage title on Thursday and extended the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly rais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday , the American women Simone Bil@@ es will be touring on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ campaign event of women at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ competition title , and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated its sport over the last three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on of her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly rais@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single @-@ multi@@ fight arena of women at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party serving retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clam@@ ation mark .
although Bil@@ es insisted , during her long journey to the top , never having planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a series of victories that will last for as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly leading through two turns , the picture sm@@ ashed .
Schwe@@ be@@ amed and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one .
they gently embra@@ ced them as they expected her en@@ der@@ ment - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ hah glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ cap , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground practice , she cast c@@ ous@@ ins to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as bil@@ es are concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass murder while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest ass@@ aults by Phoenix for a decade as they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Ro@@ ch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ firing weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the few of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left oneself to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit or craw@@ l until his third year and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth illustrates the sign language Ed@@ mund compla@@ ined for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the ic@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what was going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ic@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency department on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rain all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ding their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards Gover@@ nor informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the affected communities already underway .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that inquiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa required ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could be dropped in this area .
a flood warning system was used on Friday in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama , while still ra@@ ining in the Mobile field .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite in the neighbourhood of Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louisiana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a down@@ turn directed floods in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people from the floo@@ ding water in the areas of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , rise overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was pouring in and pouring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and transferred them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground has been considerably weigh@@ ed by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and flood floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom ou@@ tage in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS @-@ dependent travel@@ er WW@@ L reported that a subordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floods .
in the towns of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to participate , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the City Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but no reported to date on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ bs out of bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said Brown suffered multiple shooting injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital during his transport to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ench@@ ant@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ caster that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the broad@@ caster .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just identified whether one of the injured men could be the offen@@ ders .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a bon@@ fire between several gun@@ men .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were shells .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; reported police inspec@@ tor Anthony G@@ inal@@ di to the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a ag@@ ony boy when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic race in the gym@@ n@@ ast and that for more than one reason .
firstly , since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ners , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is rounded off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ ored by the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among the female gym@@ na@@ sts was an African American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old World Championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly rais@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ners in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that can be maintained by parents who pay for the training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued as much as you like .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs which can support the business .
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ al , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training .
I have founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable rates in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide high quality gymnas@@ tics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the olymp@@ ic team gold and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistant doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance specialists will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve maintenance on un@@ common clock times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee on Assistance for Assistance told last night in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce and it will be given to meet all the doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in only eight weeks , which remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through conversations ble@@ w in the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , raise the raise and address the concerns of assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they were willing to carry out further action .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13.@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide cover to doctors in the stri@@ k@@ post chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to provide a better weekly reward for the 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat actions do not reach little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the assistant doctors and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries , responded positively to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training cru@@ sts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after having been advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation agency N@@ ICE suggested a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation agency N@@ ICE suggested a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the N@@ ICE proposal published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness culture leaves sel@@ ections to blo@@ om in Muslim areas
tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man , former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man , was removed from office last year due to corruption
a culture of political correc@@ tness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being unknow@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former member of the cabinet Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral fraud due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier belts outside poll@@ s to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must simply name its name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , when they give off their bal@@ lot to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only condu@@ ci@@ ve to electoral fraud , but also to protect the communal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election scandal in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming influence on the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which elderly members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading evi@@ den@@ ces to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been placed that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or b@@ ang@@ lades@@ que background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such conduct on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke with 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists work bank@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration ex@@ ams to prevent the electoral catalog being used for immigration and welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
do not use Rem@@ e@@ able ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter code .
prohibition that political activists work full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated prosecution of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in vot@@ er stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone in the bal@@ lot box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that no criminal complaint was made after the Tower Ham@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral registr@@ ations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Supreme Court of Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gone beyond the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ clim@@ ber of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only athlete to fight the gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker on our screens during the time , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans displaying more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides Kate &apos;s double @-@ foot@@ er on the track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he appears secretly similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star , appeared .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford &apos;s British jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ foot@@ er for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh are compared to G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption
another great comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal maker Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile resem@@ bling the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like to go down &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator , By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds , thought his microphone was off when he decided to leave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ stil@@ sch@@ wimm@@ ming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , went away like a cock , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron scale 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the tone and the language
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ ello twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not en@@ capsul@@ ate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m Frei@@ stil@@ sch@@ wimm@@ el for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s commentary and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming power . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC has ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the people who have responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed very quickly and announced a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments refer to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald agreed on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman chose the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried ling@@ erie , &quot; she came back and the business left without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like because she put them on the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she liked nothing , attracted her again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to be disturbing anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly someone would take home trousers with someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to draw the pieces of clothing after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and she didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer against your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seize the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with his knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er cro@@ aches in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
at attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time transfer the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip , before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is doing Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that when it comes to rob@@ ber@@ y , it &apos;s the saf@@ est thing to hand over your money - unless you are a grand@@ master of Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ outs his tongue in Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est places for a guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and the aus@@ ole@@ ation of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a draw toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he is going to get in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the light .
the thought of le@@ aking up the sink of a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left him left , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known for testing the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to stations to flush @-@ but@@ ting toilets , the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he definitely did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test sample showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric quantity of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet he refused to de@@ file after its lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units while fresh washed hands have less than 60 units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr W@@ right and the Finnish producer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
I won &apos;t dock here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended saying that we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he &apos;d like to lick some of the things I told him to lick like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick it off and others in which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall destro@@ ys the social family before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their home after a del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ di were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , po@@ ets of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be demoli@@ shed , old tr@@ ash was found .
they were pil@@ ed up in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past ;
neighbors testi@@ fied that they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing made her and her partner forci@@ bly separated from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was che@@ ered by reli@@ eved neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been administ@@ ering the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police were established at regular intervals , for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step taken into account by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ ging on the ground .
workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having ple@@ aded guilty to own@@ ing a class B drug in trade .
she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will move tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police told that the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall &apos;s police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual military jet flies on the beach
sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an unbelievable storm
the Air Force said it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ected jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers at the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up , as they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the engines , without seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro have panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them .
the spokesman said that due to poor visibility due to poor visibility conditions , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insisted that the security had not been je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised at any time .
land fires have destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people coming to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that due to circumstances - strong fog and smoke , the pilot had to fly so deeply , which limits his point of view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first time in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the re@@ play takes three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ prize winner must ren@@ ounce N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s defeated Cup@@ resour@@ ses and reign@@ ing Europe @-@ League Champion on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
in the training , the German suffered a b@@ anding of lig@@ ament in the knee , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s entry was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
in this regard , Coach Luis En@@ rique finally gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen was the champion in most of the rest .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness of the crew at the Spanish Master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal stop at S@@ amp@@ le@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince .
Sevilla , on the other hand , has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of this race .
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided fin@@ als and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.1 4.4 ) .
so the world ranking first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with victories at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they didn &apos;t have coaches .
they had withdrawn to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches so far I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said logical .
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the tempo to the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match didn &apos;t develop .
nevertheless , sufficient breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ R@@ ene had a rib@@ ose injury , followed by medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have , by the way , become Olympic @-@ Fourth in similar high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants &quot; enormous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has the weakness of his election campaign in the present Republi@@ can High Court U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed this as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame was false reports on his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his famous media elte .
Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ack
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor came up with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not with the distance customary for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview from the CN@@ BC channel , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I &apos;ve done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and check afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that &apos;s fine , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans want to get stronger under the arms for Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics : Tri@@ ster Sc@@ am on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ oping @-@ Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials reported that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , submitted a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich in the Olympic Village .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will perform an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and sold himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , delivered the specimen and signed it , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was about 800 meters in Beijing in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have been informed about pending d@@ oping tests against cash payments of his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , an unusual point was pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya picked up Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is con@@ forming to the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly alleged that in Kenya dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und ultimately requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had made her in the Russian athle@@ tics field .
it has been proven that this kind of sport has been applied nationwide and in a systematic way .
ther@@ eu@@ pon Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly topical : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join IS re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death several weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the Group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
sul@@ tana was sevent@@ een years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with going into a war zone - to prevent people from meeting this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the East of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Supreme Court judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Senate Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation from its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell has the opinion that the next president will nom@@ inate the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Rei@@ d later said that he would not have talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not provide un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and auxili@@ aries of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .

the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes itself , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes it also does the calendar .
&quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish town@@ ship reck@@ ons on mass ev@@ asion
&quot; those who don &apos;t care and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of people seeking protection from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with legal sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey .
after the sh@@ ei@@ led coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ etic cities .
Erdo@@ gan is therefore willing to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the association demanded that the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len suppor@@ ter destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t adapt themselves and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alist and Sa@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports by calling on numbers from the Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum @-@ justified asylum seekers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this would have been 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all eligible patients ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there are not those who are fighting against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum @-@ justified according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
by the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament of Schwer@@ in has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s more stupid than so far : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that bites .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a local people , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count votes in the end , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the suff@@ rage and last holiday of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to make an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting will be how strong new@@ bie Af@@ D will cut off and what remains at the end of coalition stor@@ my .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , spreads roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary prec@@ inct predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has speed@@ ed up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes election campaigns at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale meetings ; Merkel &apos;s election district is in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , Kok@@ ert thinks , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you are crum@@ bling the base so that it has to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people .
you see it as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden wedding recep@@ tions , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD gained a clear victory of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of vac@@ ations and reloc@@ ate their campaign largely to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is the name of the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green election fighters go to search for local vocal folds among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , runs straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and finds it even more beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated there is nothing to complain about .
there is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning .
&quot; they did everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the half @-@ season , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
the same applies to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to furnishing housing entran@@ ces .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic passes through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many people were looking for easier ways and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks resi@@ ded in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality began to ampli@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the spot .
two to three per minute have been bra@@ ised .
the quick@@ est speed was 77 km per hour at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been extended , however , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that now the road is open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue streams leaves everyone who is questioned .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attri@@ bution is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals are migh@@ ti@@ est shaken along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only it , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues increased to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his co @-@ workers .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise be able to benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something is more gener@@ ously handled .
with all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
but G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the fact that his pedi@@ gree is coming back at the end of the re@@ development work .
despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of B 27 works on his clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , it &apos;s brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of fighting terrorism , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also ze@@ al@@ ously beg@@ ged myself there@@ to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère nar@@ rowed a little time before presenting his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security agency will take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities does not come as a surprise either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt for proposals not to be done with the SPD : he wants to off@@ end sympath@@ is@@ ers for terrorist groups and push jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult issues for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything , which doesn &apos;t have any chances in the case of a coalition partner .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people before deportation .
refugees who are deliberately brought to the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the event of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse things worse than before - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to mask their identity .
some of it is political and legally delicate .
some still have an in@@ ex@@ pedi@@ ment and are open to questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ es@@ y - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high numbers of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that employed people deeply could not be clas@@ sed even in election campaig@@ ning times .
the focus is on inner security .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the topic of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , between the two parties it was high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ tian argument concerning the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from dual citizenship .
also here de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is a lot of con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he does not receive anything from a departure from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
making them new , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ long itself in the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel kindly conve@@ ys a cau@@ tious willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
in spite of diesel prices , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall campaign , vor@@ tices are about a term .
Volkswagen is entering the second half of the year as a result of deliveries .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ circul@@ ating markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to present a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ circul@@ ating markets .
but in July , the VW brand weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus again exer@@ ted a heavy toll on the sales of the company , such as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than the previous year &apos;s figure with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales alone in Western Europe , China , the second most important market , posted sales of 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
head of the brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann under@@ took the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days , less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some key markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also bur@@ dened the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Niedersachsen is further off due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more cars at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had rig@@ ged with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to convert into workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car@@ makers point out a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate according to the change@@ over , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reasons are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for re@@ bo@@ unding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed Volkswagen &apos;s representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA Complete &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all the relevant vehicle values have remained stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come into a workshop approximately half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important in the interest of customers to avoid any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal , to prevent uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands special interest from rich as@@ par@@ ag@@ us in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
chief bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : ordinary savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t have to worry about paying penalty for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this fee charges the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from private and corporate customers for deposits over € 100,000 on sight deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he has been jumping 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now continuing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to leave cash in the counters of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy approach causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its 2014 Sk@@ at@@ bank branch with criminal charges for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a clientele at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is a little more generous from the wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she keeps money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known for any further banks which charge a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually buy vinyl records ?
lonely middle aged men love plates .
before you come to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ Impres@@ sionist men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all pre@@ views , between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit before I stop , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly getting its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mood through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I read from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room .
the reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phoenix to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received imp@@ etus from the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers , from items that wake up happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector so and I think that it is so with many people .
it is an easy way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee inf@@ ring@@ es a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while stro@@ king through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just came in here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead disc so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ free , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only come in slowly .
f@@ lop , which has devoted to the records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience than I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz is re@@ conc@@ iled from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but psychological trauma is hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
she rather makes a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to mu@@ ddle the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a crossover record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as panels .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v make it , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums , are not taken into account .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the star@@ ry look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who worries about the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects an offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional stores where individuals within the camp offer goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had the 72 provisional transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were &quot; absolutely trace@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which is non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants &quot; rated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympics @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his disap@@ pointing performance at the Olympic time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; I keep an eye on the world championship , stay confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s journey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to analyse in peace , what reasons would lead to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday .

the technology company bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft , on Thursday , did not share how much money is spent on the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can look at others while playing , but also interfere with yourself .
for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the game giant Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is said to help .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are tested , which are intended to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden will be used for example at accident points where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary tem@@ pos , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a steady stream of lightning to comply with the speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
reinforcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as travel restrictions after time , driving strips and vehicle class can be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer is able to move in a highly @-@ driven state with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order for it to not simply be cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear without a sho@@ ck@@ proof outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
even foreign authorities flash@@ ed with the new technique : recently France ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by in the final on Thursday evening came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side stit@@ ching , re@@ press , line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji wouldn &apos;t have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably doesn &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lose only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is ast@@ ounding .
Fi@@ ji started mira@@ cul@@ ously and boun@@ ced off the attacks of GB@@ s .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell prevented the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa from achieving a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped it .
in the seventh minute , Y@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a show@@ down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning since the re@@ pu@@ ff and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB resulted in fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ushing into the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ inal@@ ised gold as in these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 tough P@@ ieve , which goes into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without a tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9th un@@ beaten work , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no more instrumental than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept interrup@@ ting to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repeat what I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked as well .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for 31 years provided for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian way exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original on a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the purpose of purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of staff at the age of 31 , stands behind all this , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congreg@@ ations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water @-@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , moderni@@ zation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always been added to innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum in Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ wart and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the fountain building and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights from his point of view .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the tu@@ b@@ ular quar@@ ry at Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because one filled the high @-@ bay of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called upon us and stated to have shot his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him I will be prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
the one who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck at first did not want to provide information about the ta@@ vern or the relationship between the perpet@@ rator and the victim ; however , she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to witnesses , a special case squ@@ ad ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ stri@@ pped and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed of additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from green power transport are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion among the existing plants for so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach it after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry saw an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Com@@ peti@@ tive Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent will apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the issue of emissions , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , when the world &apos;s largest producer of products cast iron on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price d@@ umping in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the mass produced went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an increase in orders due to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has always accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing is moving me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
for many years , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior division .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co @-@ operation , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
this is because sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand his lungs don &apos;t get so fast out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der senior @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often watches that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
due to lyrics and especially melodies , dementia patients fall back to long @-@ distance events .
in addition , when singing , a particular performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice so as not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows also through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who &apos;s going to hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the appropriate offer Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors letter , one can easily join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly .
many senior choir members can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers to scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect is the so@@ ot of cat babies on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ cks did not let the males too cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the sounds of kit@@ tens , who think in big trouble as scientists have found out about the Veter@@ inary Academy of Sciences and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males are also responding to the calls of kit@@ tens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten cries were different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
altogether nine adult males and eight female cats from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of small children who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ tens which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned to the loud@@ speakers much faster , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very sof@@ ter kit@@ tens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women react sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the ri@@ vals of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no stopping of football even before football .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r Stark@@ i@@ cker .
according to this , the South African living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is being held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed at first for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has almost no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as all the country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved his athle@@ tic value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top @-@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record Master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also set out early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it reached only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this , and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasons ap@@ tly as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King , laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
after the coup attempt at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez was only released after the coup attempt to not return to his European holiday due to the political situation in the country .
&quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; was quoted by the chief b@@ aker F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to wai@@ ve around one third of his annual life estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin &apos;s 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers , Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about a D@@ oping lock shortly before the games , was un@@ mer@@ cil@@ essly whi@@ pped off at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a smile she was still standing in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a storm of applause .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after you &apos;ve been using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest male in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has received so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand in Olympics @-@ Silber 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone deficiency .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world champion and gold fav@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell off and ran on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson for the foreign ministry , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I had already been able to leave it again .
her home trip was scheduled for early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as Sch@@ nö@@ ll .
in about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
two explo@@ sives then went on Friday morning , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported in Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police .
finally Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast required several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to express himself to possible motives - most likely , however , is the actions of Muslim rebels .
in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which limits itself to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of the opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were put in place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security related to important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not direct themselves against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ cl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding areas .
confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations will not be necessary to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this grants great influence to the military in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , has prof@@ essed to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels that have been sm@@ oul@@ dering in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Federal Government have also placed the group under surveillance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional amend@@ ment Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Niedersachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities when deciding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an ad@@ ful ad@@ vert for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; identified &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
he said that he did not know what to do .
for constitutional protection , potential contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee protests or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be identified .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ o@@ y expressed that many attacks on the account of people that were previously not appearing in the right scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects who attacked asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that had previously nothing at all with the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who have then radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
Olympi@@ ans or world records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous presence of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ré during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia f@@ lowed so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not a sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received special status law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to popul@@ ate swimming in under@@ represented countries .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ la wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cked him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a walk over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympic only eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternate video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will happen either , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candid@@ acy of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post enters into trading with electric vans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles also on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post office spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they will be delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ ber had said that there are always requests , for example by arti@@ sans .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company will soon enter into mass production of vehicles .
in post@@ production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the company would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change over the environment @-@ friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Consumer Research Group Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
ad@@ missions came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K let us imagine that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more in@@ secure , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again disap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management , the worldwide number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
the company will leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck , former Executive Board member , already handed over the management to the Executive Board on 1 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to officially assume the role of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details didn &apos;t want to be called a company spokesman on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in future .
in An@@ unci@@ on &apos;s circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were ultimately big disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ Top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruit of restructuring , however , has not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will become uns@@ ett@@ led at some point .
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not be able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
earnings in the second quarter , above all , imp@@ acted the decline in the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , led to the Group a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into c@@ umm@@ ber@@ e in Gra@@ ben : eight Ver@@ sions
in case of an accident of a bus with 43 sen@@ iors than passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to legend , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck , partly on the back@@ track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back to the town of P@@ ew@@ all by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare Valley 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros respectively ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.1 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ ly calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the household was approved by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , they found that under@@ cover for these sewage treatment plants .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the budget .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period must also be compensated .
Schmidt explained the serious charge increases with the fact that all three sewage treatment plants were relatively small establishments with a very small sewage plant , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the retro@@ fitting period of calculation , there was considerable scope for all three plants , not least due to their age of refurbish@@ ment and repair costs .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt noted that in the waste water plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be out@@ dated from the ground and the first sewage pond had to be installed after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ law requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; in addition to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully bu@@ cked . &quot;
Schmidt explained that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed during the last 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al could not be extended for these facilities because it is a lack of public facilities .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % deb@@ ited .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as pre@@ mon@@ ed for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables some 150 million users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ ended , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps arrive at the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have raised criticism in the past when they were accused of using the App Black@@ face support or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it struck a filter by some users this week , which gave them mor@@ ti@@ sing eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said to be unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ able , but that the yellow face has been moved to the degra@@ ding extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s large audience of young people - who are more different than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that insul@@ ts for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engine@@ ered for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , called for others to do the same .
in an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that gender @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the practice practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer who focused on sub@@ mis@@ sive population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said they will leave their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military Gui@@ ding For@@ ty IS@@ IS Secret Service Information , Stand@@ ings Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , a committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence committees and military budget com@@ mitt@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ sus , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically dul@@ led by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism , which could have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are enough to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given guidance to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure on their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues .
in addition , there are further investigations into the Cent@@ Com reports by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense in progress .
democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the com@@ mitt@@ tee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was excessive enough space for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no indications of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor suspected of complaints by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ torate were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have had an impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the en@@ closures about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st Gregory Hoo@@ ker wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush accused only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting about the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legis@@ lative Assembly for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins four @-@ fourth match in the women &apos;s field hockey , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after shooting three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they couldn &apos;t remember that they have ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , this is what they know : the American women are in the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed player will take a little longer to the strong Dutch from the path that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder to ro@@ am completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door @-@ strike in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without any victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the Olympic Games R@@ age , the Zen of the Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed competition between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning stick that is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time being at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could well have been under these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner , or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted : aerial guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for an un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a drow@@ ned enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unite it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging victorious jumps jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme you will be judged according to the execution , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two and a half athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold will have to go farther , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the tel@@ ev@@ ised broadcast another high objective : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the targeted aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I perceive as something ti@@ res@@ ome when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly up again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will em@@ it the en@@ dr@@ ons as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2.@@ 00 p.m .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through ang@@ ling and obj@@ ecting male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently suggested - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his air rin@@ ding , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security agents strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Africa Project Manager of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to combat terror threats throughout the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba , capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of changing H@@ ink@@ öch@@ lar@@ n under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which does it at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians announced that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly Christian high @-@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims live and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who are about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
in contrast to Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ e@@ thiop@@ ia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al was 2005 , after thousands protest against elections which , according to analysts , were apparently deceived by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure plans , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ic city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hate towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for the bombar@@ d@@ ment of the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has been established IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ling that his repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would not have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication drew up new questions about the communication skills of Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its co @-@ workers , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of having to explain the statements he did not mean at all .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump dropped back in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo assets to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he made strong critic@@ isms when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I told the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of resol@@ ving the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is published on Friday showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempting to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ le has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of the world , was struggling to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was questioned about Mr. Obama &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ yards , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton minist@@ ered as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of ro@@ aming each of his words and taking action against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
once sup@@ planted by the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a stylish cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people claimed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is changing , it is also new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained many things .
verb used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same bul@@ bs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ es like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the verb .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the fall in 2003 .
he went to work there and always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came four quarters after seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not regret that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for bre@@ wing with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ pointed , also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to leave them soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the pub and ordering a new coffee was felt like hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , schn@@ au@@ c@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix .
when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ acking , this found the couple suitable for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap which reaches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as serving them for dinner .
co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet , especially in rural areas .
team of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is drawing the paths with which the country was going to be no longer the land of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e committed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ aet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a seldom servi@@ ced luxury .
odd mix@@ tures were tried out , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick @-@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economics recipes .
as never before or ever , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , pushed the country &apos;s eating habits between 1923 and 1943 .
by publi@@ ci@@ zing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ pie @-@ eating attitude .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ aire man from the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours given by Ms. Roosev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book , for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick one rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the pre@@ f@@ ect of the wind .
after the dishes were emp@@ tied at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which ate President Roosev@@ elt for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a chic name .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pr@@ un@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown g@@ litter .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E took a second stop three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he told his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed during bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection officer , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol of the symbol in the hor@@ r@@ ors of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he never saw himself as heroes , but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die trying to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrels above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb for not children to play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b@@ ings of the Assad regime were to hit terrorists .

lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 metres .
only when it counts , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on a steep 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments on the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed to be stone @-@ old for a long time .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ ie .
their slow motion , they measured six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt down the sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the Arctic Sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ments from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cm was measured .
to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the sh@@ arks nucle@@ us .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search exac@@ erb@@ ated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal , with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 concentrations in their nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long shar@@ k @-@ shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy the length of an age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
that should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ites live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , whose bacon on the neck put a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often also runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building site in a double pack
the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on topics related to building construction in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the board adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clearing the land , clearing and closing questions and surve@@ ying the applications for surve@@ ying , the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; road path &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( division 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can inform themselves immediately in the town hall , the allocation of the plots is expected to be deliber@@ ated by the municipal council in its September session .
in order to also make inquiries about the establishment of further industrial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created land use plan in partial areas only in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n , the already designated industrial area is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main therefore has the best chances to attract employment and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W area of competence and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether they may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to be approved in the UK .
that is how big US banks use it .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , has united the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk state ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also makes it worse for the infrastructure of Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , and less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin in No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes .
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , econom@@ ists believe .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US Federal Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on behalf of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US @-@ based judge Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to align with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ ru@@ ed each other and took possession of laboratory work , of which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was underlying , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ ga@@ j from the Islamic State
the United States supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ de@@ je , near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left it , said a group spokesman on Friday .
according to the statement of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently fighting the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Reu@@ ters military council , which was allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under full control , but we are conducting clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , chi@@ ef@@ ly to Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ aren ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ als behind false statements and rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions regarding his previous promises to release his tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump consultant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax inspections are not completed .
critics , among others the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business ties and various other links , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ threw himself on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls on his tax declaration to be published .
on Thursday , she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return by the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clinton in 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ works support dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensified its promotion along with U.S. natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day phone number dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ ly cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom stops with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ powder into the air .
a hint is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer that fires a gol@@ fing fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the town council unanim@@ ously rejected the proposal for the construction of a sales ski@@ bus on the Rhine bank near the Rhine conv@@ ent under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not suit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes in Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demand - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots enth@@ r@@ alled a media uprising after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election , as it would have claimed Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
... More information Version Band@@ width M@@ apping
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet where people called it a scandal .
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have yiel@@ ded to the alleged demands of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
added that the country code is now added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting bra@@ zi@@ lian students
students clas@@ hed with the police in Sao Paulo Brazilian city on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which caused the police to insert rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts spra@@ ying on walls against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ round .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , the ambassador shared with him .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing ties with Iran , while new firms are willing to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the exchange rate between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representation abroad issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

sh@@ arks : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ ons from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ ef@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were tac@@ kled .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ atic journey of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna &apos;s primary round of mini@@ stries is determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms arose .
in the evening , Re@@ ver@@ end Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m @-@ Cru@@ ces and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ m @-@ sa@@ ws .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster In@@ ser@@ er loving wife is standing and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s path started from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field cruise , chap@@ els or churches always r@@ ushed to sing together a song from a specially created pilgri@@ m song .
the parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and for@@ ti@@ fying dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after , one entered St. Peter &apos;s stage , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at first about 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral in the later afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .

the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor roller , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med his home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they scored a modest sixth place at the London railroad World Championships in London in spite of his resignation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champions .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was a hint that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the stands like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we &apos;ve got so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win over again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of cycle .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for the British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues tomorrow and ends , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ bbing @-@ repro@@ aches as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land melting facility due to ann@@ ul@@ ment of energy consumption question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melt of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the supply contract and thereby aboli@@ shes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company has distributed .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision to grant no further subsidies to operate the plant in Victoria at the beginning of this year .
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure .
moreover , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting shop , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closing .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and la@@ stly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which is owned by the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting facility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L believes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not affect &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is yet another explanation why it res@@ igned from the Treaty .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt company in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analy@@ st statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans of Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party .
this constitutes the c@@ lich@@ é act almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ re brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris has to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most sold @-@ selling edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an image band as a fashion journal , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep prior to official announcement .
women who were on the cover are Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model@@ ate &quot; as &quot; models , who are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though it &apos;s all true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success for everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them and called them &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings were flas@@ hing up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centre centers have 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s emergency services are rejected annually by the municipal financial centers while the industry is preparing for the impact of further mi@@ tigation on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the parish centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centre Centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without lifting the decision of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Joint Research Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Gener@@ alb@@ un@@ des@@ prosec@@ utor and the Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the Land government met its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is time to look at the needs of the community centre and its customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of allegedly moving weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was accused of alleged lack of activity after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on one employee in February while she was traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte , by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i gave up for months to have waited for the matter to be regulated internally before it realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment only came two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms friends - should take action in case his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge .
the campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint requests damages from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and of Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ ing press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before the elections : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are recorded for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could not go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD r@@ ushed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally short of the CD@@ U , which could come to 23 percent again .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previous 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , while the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag at 3 percent each .
according to the survey , according to the Berlin survey , only 23 per cent of the survey ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) could be achieved .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it was still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but left to the left with 15 percent ( 11.@@ 7 percent before ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return but the pirates would not miss the introduction compared to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
his success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was also not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to stores just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in Western media format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could set a lot for that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit agon@@ izing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates suppliers , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online anywhere and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units are accounted for .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone in the meantime .
the key breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced at the Mac World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ w now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , who is responsible for personnel in the Siemens management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of he@@ a@@ ways , just as in 2012 in London when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in natural growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the same . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to identify which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ ggle is underway between the open source community and the revolution@@ ists since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying banner block@@ ers have become for the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook on their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues fac@@ ebook .
the company has set it apart from desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , announced a spokesman .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investing in such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences &quot; pool to have more control over the adverti@@ sed advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman in suspected mur@@ dering on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was driven by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid herself in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was taken over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident asked to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter reported to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a police officer of the negli@@ gent killing was acqu@@ itted after having passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had d@@ rank and became unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected such conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly rot@@ ated .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its tag@@ on @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected of planet scientists .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back to A@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos;s coach
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also has to have a right of determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and we wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer in the league .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 trademark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference in five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 per cent as a result of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed hundreds of thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had stepped up by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place ever since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope astronom@@ ers has helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary creation .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , created some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an appreci@@ able star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very light stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and why stars slow@@ ed their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran out with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional dis@@ miss@@ al announcement , the 41 year old pro will face the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last August on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to become the most valuable player in the League , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ ens , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he created the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players score similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Ruh@@ mes@@ halle of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so cont@@ ested is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis scandal , it was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting remedies for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends still get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy conver@@ sions by the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ ri@@ vals Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the trailer at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned athlete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have been known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ i@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the already critically informed athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Ch@@ en full cooperation in the studies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of the athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news broke through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ kov@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the banned substance should act as an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ i@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already had a positive impact .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v informed himself promptly with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the event &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days earlier on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the ing@@ es@@ tion , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the Dan@@ i@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the whole Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the Kenya country produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the course of swimming , the previous violations in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
for example , Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ering purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the Chinese championships , Sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
mystery Chron@@ icles : betra@@ y@@ als of Love
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware use targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware anti @-@ malware specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators special@@ ise in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to exp@@ end ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently witn@@ essing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertisements .
then the perpetrators found black@@ mail software for themselves .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred in recent months frigh@@ tening fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files like Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
in order to get the end@@ key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of stagn@@ ation in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and came to the conclusion : the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their victims by chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites , or de@@ code sample files for free .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate partly hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively high risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the malware @-@ kits have been created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then search for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the underground forums , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected machine .
&quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 per cent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on them to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware via file backup and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not enough threat to successful revenue , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing speculation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential damage potential is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the con conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rator then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , the passengers have plenty of room both in the first row and in the rear .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top falls down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l in folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
his work is likely to be a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is very grati@@ fying .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the security systems is the city emergency brake assistant ( operates up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the smart control bar responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
because a liability is conceivable only for risks that are typical of air traffic , the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff broke down a knee injury .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general life risk , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer pay ?
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money after their trip if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been reported to have the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ ish foli@@ age .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a faul@@ ty treatment plant that supposedly so@@ iled sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs were not successful .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers heard about it shortly before the arrival of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he therefore did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , such as the judgement .
especially since no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must react wis@@ ely and decisi@@ vely at the same time to terrorist acts .
one thing is certain : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and sch@@ isms .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if perpetrators need to leave the country faster , this increases security and also strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals up to the 2017 presidential election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , namely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit scale over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism should again be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , am@@ mun@@ ition can be am@@ ended so much that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be kept in words according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical frat@@ ernity , he wants to search for solutions , such as the threat of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a glance at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD boss Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of double nationality .
he considers a general ban on full @-@ veil claims under constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway inter@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ umps up regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal regulation is to be extended .
this is good news for all car @-@ rac@@ ers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic on the surrounding road when they travel via the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler Road by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic for@@ ks early , thus improving the overall flow of life on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys mot@@ orists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days are enough to reach the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous eye on B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic is guided only one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb two @-@ lane heavy traffic .
as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected traffic con@@ ges@@ tion continue , the responsible state company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal regulation , the state company deliberately chose the low @-@ traffic time during the school holidays because it is due to disabilities .
traffic is tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a musical project .
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people to visit cultural institutions in Münster , with migration and refugee background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the students of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without a refugee and migrant background between 14 and 20 years old are said to have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language transfer are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ sch@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke by the bill in the southwest of Germany during the night - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain , to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you don &apos;t think about sleep anymore .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults has sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rather than relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons for them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society of S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and through @-@ sleep .
just falling asleep will feel many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on one another .
those who , for example , have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der over everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s a trial .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Pil@@ l Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphas@@ ises the lack of medical exam@@ in@@ ers in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems with your sleep problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for the examination in sleep lab doctors , for example , advise doctors in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of abnormal fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after disgu@@ ising , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping end at the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
the process counts : regular sleeping and up@@ setting times , not lying too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcoholic and not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook about the disap@@ pointing cut off of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ ground world championships and at the same time set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his prot@@ rac@@ ted ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 150@@ ,000 € no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on the night on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see or even operate on the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ tist would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who are not able to control a certain amount of time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election Hamburg , who meanwhile runs an ice cream maker .
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Li@@ ves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
civilian investig@@ ators from the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ - and baggage @-@ theft as a band .
at 9.@@ 30@@ pm , civilian officials in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen of by@@ gone th@@ ief off@@ enses .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ ts since the middle of July and were treated in a community , rigid and very professional manner .
the specialist of crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four actions to the di@@ ver , which had been specially travelled to Germany to commit crimes .
they had over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den baths , in between still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like at first glance , but the police belong to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed shortly , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has voted for a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew @-@ cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the uni@@ denti@@ fied home owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raised three children here , are primarily irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority police protection from the vac@@ ant left .
the tren@@ ch , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between the squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared under large police orders in a regular street battle many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people , who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from all over the world . residents from East Germany and former home squ@@ at@@ ters now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in the disc@@ arded discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are according to statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make fac@@ tions that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house near the 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are definitely not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the Riga city .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the R@@ ī@@ ga street - and has remained .
that is why it was so important to it that the residents get back home : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of the time suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that sup@@ plant the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people tend to live here that are not so well wor@@ ned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of people who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone pulling in a pub area , can complain poorly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the car@@ ving wool of wool , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking but rather on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a de@@ fle@@ cted wool @-@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has fixed a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka is supporting German and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you have to place the refugees in your own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear local authority .
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in reality the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not working to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be re@@ clo@@ cked , as it is said so beautifully .
so soon new containers will soon be placed in the washing line .
but it is not only with apartments .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
besides a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , training places , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be f@@ um@@ bed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do not do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , says Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach will not work , and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people in which nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the most recent incidents , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some might call nai@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ vo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so basic and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
the policy is elu@@ ci@@ dated by this question .
it is actually unfair to hire them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already at full capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
currently , these are around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter searched
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forci@@ bly forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the de@@ vil@@ s into the flight .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well @-@ mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded jum@@ pers .
they fled to the city center .
for the prosecution , the police deployed several stripes and a police helicopter .
