<seg id="1">Golfer Langer wins the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on horseback are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid of sport" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the system of the ALRV, he didn't even swear by a horse for taking photographs.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Pyramid of Sports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honours to the likeable sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already plagued him.</seg>

<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "for it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been fostering the young generation for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Helper Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">In doubt, Trump seeks to keep them small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive regulations massively and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that it must be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment schemes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical Teaparty-Wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, some party-internal discussions could come up.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and recharge coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in protected areas, which aims to terminate the Parisian climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme:" "" "a country will be the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "TPP, the" "" "transponder" "" "trade agreement, do not want to sign both." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but rather only to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should also be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rattled, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics think that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each baby has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentral accommodation for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "in women, other reasons are outweighed:" "" "many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">Who think that as soon as they come to Germany, Irish, Bahr recounts.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District Registraints are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether or not they know about a similar project like in Munich, some say no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not separated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelfranken there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the paramedics have called upon their union to approve new labour disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour disputes from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly by his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been any worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I seemed to suggest that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that the head of state had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speeches: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The going was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West since it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued grudge over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" in Russia and Turkey: two countries that have driven away from the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the common reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents expressed their opinion at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin humidifies Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of the tightest of confidence in Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special commissioner for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is stated that Putin ordered" "" "the release of Ivanovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy for 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he later served as the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's main task to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked me to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of Vladimir Putin's strictest confidence and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will retire at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile of the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, would once again want to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say to me this very complicated item - you could almost say to entrust for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, President of Russia could become President of Russia, as a third term had violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's coup, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling fans" "", "approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first shutter is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure is forward-looking high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was accomplished by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive since the viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. 6.000 tons and had to be moved upwards in an ascent of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: in future, investors should take much stronger responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D vice-president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must now have 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the left still wants to be tougher for investors." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, according to Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is imminent.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-of-date ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, we would have to think about bringing apartments back into price.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">The aim of Pokemon Go is to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created from it).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person withdraws every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, has recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time" to "come out of the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also mowing crustaceans who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphones apps like Fitbit have already been able to track down our activity, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">But because of the success of Pokemons, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday, the American women Simone Biles will be touring on the balance beam during the single multi-campaign event of women at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competition title, and in total the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated its sport over the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson of her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so very between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a series of victories that will last for as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was slightly leading through two turns, the picture smashed.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest assaults by Phoenix for a decade as they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-firing weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told that the threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery attack because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic neighborhoods within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympic race in the gymnast and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the catholic is rounded off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirrored by the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an African American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics that can be maintained by parents who pay for the training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as much as you like.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in affluent suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Bilal, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable rates in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide high quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine portrayal of "Girl Power" by holding the olympic team gold and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and the ausoleation of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a draw toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object he used a luminometer to show himself and show us what he is going to get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking up the sink of a draw toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left him left, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known for testing the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to stations to flush-butting toilets, the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he definitely did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test sample showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric quantity of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to defile after its luminometer number was over 4000 units while fresh washed hands have less than 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't dock here because it's disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system development.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we led crazy brainstorming that ended saying that we told" "" "Let us call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he'd like to lick some of the things I told him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick it off and others in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their home after a deloculation with a damage in the amount of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebildi were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, poets of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">They were piled up in the property in which drugs were traded in the past;</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors testified that they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing made her and her partner forcibly separated from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deloculation was cheered by relieved neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't care for anybody." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been administering the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police were established at regular intervals, for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the renter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogiation is always the last step taken into account by Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deloging on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having pleaded guilty to owning a class B drug in trade.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will move tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police told that the deloculation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this is about those who think they can behave without self-reproaches and those who have been harmed by such behavior," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan Conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with melancholy about Tony, while the younger Maria is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Maria's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and bright and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is wise, naturally also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an immensely generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="4">By the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament of Schwerin has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the half-season, and everything will be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The same applies to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to furnishing housing entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic passes through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were partly considerable complaints," "" "says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the transport-related management of the rehabilitation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many people were looking for easier ways and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks resided in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality began to amplify the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself a spot on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been braised.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest speed was 77 km per hour at the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been extended, however, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that now the road is open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue streams leaves everyone who is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The locals are mightiest shaken along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only it, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road marking was" "" "thrown back for two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise be able to benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something is more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all suits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">But Göhner has no doubts about the fact that his pedigree is coming back at the end of the redevelopment work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of B 27 works on his clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, it's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buy vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym non-AlleImpressionist men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the resurgence of vinyl records is not on a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all previews, between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbys - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit before I stop, hold my hands and say something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly getting its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mood through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I read from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle aged, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phoenix to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received impetus from the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that wake up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think that it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee infringes a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while stroking through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came in here and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead disc so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-free, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Flop, which has devoted to the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz is reconciled from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychological trauma is hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "she casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm pretending to muddle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "panel art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov make it, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the starry look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who worries about the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional stores where individuals within the camp offer goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "were" absolutely traceable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camp, which is non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side stitching, repress, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji wouldn't have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably doesn't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lose only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started miraculously and bounced off the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hustle and bustle of Mitchell prevented the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa from achieving a third goal, but Fiji only stopped it.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Yasa Veremalua left a showdown in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning since the repuff and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinalised gold as in these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 tough Pieve, which goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th unbeaten work, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental progress that make the difference and it was no more instrumental than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept interrupting to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve-raising morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="8">Rupert Göller, who was a member of staff at the age of 31, stands behind all this, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The congregations are the municipalities of Kirchder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairperson, Breitbrunns mayor of Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water-wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), property purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, modernization of the high container (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always been added to innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum in Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Stewart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterwart and he was a faithful cap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">He described the fountain building and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights from his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the rupture of the tubular quarry at Kirchberg on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because one filled the high-bay of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-stripped and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared of additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry from green power transport are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition among the existing plants for so-called" "" "self-electricity production in the German steel industry," "" "said German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach it after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry saw an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Competitive Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify, when the world's largest producer of products cast iron on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has been somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the end ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the mass produced went back to the second month in a row.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has always accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is moving me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For many years, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular co-operation, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in the positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs don't get so fast out of the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der senior-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often watches that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, dementia patients fall back to long-distance events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, when singing, a particular performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice so as not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows also through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's going to hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer Seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors letter, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choir members can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two explosives then went on Friday morning, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the beach of Patong popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast and in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast required several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same signature," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"we assume that it is a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express himself to possible motives - most likely, however, is the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt, or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which limits itself to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of the opponents of the ruling military junta were put in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "in recent days, the authorities have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security related to important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not direct themselves against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years of Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhcla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">Confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations will not be necessary to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This grants great influence to the military in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody upheaval, has professed to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels that have been smouldering in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an overly calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>

<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as trade and industrial companies from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the budget.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period must also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious charge increases with the fact that all three sewage treatment plants were relatively small establishments with a very small sewage plant, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the retrofitting period of calculation, there was considerable scope for all three plants, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be outdated from the ground and the first sewage pond had to be installed after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water-law requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "in addition to these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully bucked."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt explained that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spared during the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Friesenbachtal could not be extended for these facilities because it is a lack of public facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blended, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have raised criticism in the past when they were accused of using the App Blackface support or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when it struck a filter by some users this week, which gave them mortising eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "yellowish face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowable, but that the yellow face has been moved to the degrading extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's large audience of young people - who are more different than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that insults for a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineered for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, called for others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview, she said that gender-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the practice practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their staff so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Guiding Forty ISIS Secret Service Information, Standings Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, a committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Republican members of the army committees, intelligence committees and military budget committes, reports of great discontent among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Census, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically dulled by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism, which could have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican Member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom are enough to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given guidance to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure on their superiors to draw a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, there are further investigations into the CentCom reports by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense in progress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "the highest-ranking democrat in the committtee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged morality among analysts and" "" "was excessive enough space for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no indications of the White House intervention in the CentCom analyst with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspector suspected of complaints by CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">T. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspectorate were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have had an impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the enclosures about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush accused only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting about the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to indicate government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative Assembly for his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in his hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Olympic Games Rage, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable, a fast-paced competition between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning stick that is handed down from the wristband to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time being at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been under these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, turner, or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted: aerial guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a drowned enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victorious jumps jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and salts) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme you will be judged according to the execution, difficulty level and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two and a half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold will have to go farther, faster, upwards and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the televised broadcast another high objective: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I perceive as something tiresome when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will emit the endrons as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2.00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through angling and objecting male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently suggested - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his air rinding, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security agents strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Africa Project Manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to combat terror threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa, capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of changing Hinköchlarn under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which does it at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians announced that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who are mainly Christian high-lands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims live and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who are about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">In contrast to Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a upheaval was 2005, after thousands protest against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently deceived by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure plans, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amperic city, attacked by Tigray and hate towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for the bombardment of the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has been established ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angling that his repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification drew up new questions about the communication skills of Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its co-workers, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain the statements he did not mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump dropped back in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt down to Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo assets to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already taken sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he made strong criticisms when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I told the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolving the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corroborated tone, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris published on Friday showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempting to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while intensifying the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumple has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of the world, was struggling to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani so he was questioned about Mr. Obama's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backyards, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton ministered as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of roaming each of his words and taking action against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the poor, miserable" "" "TV experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apologies as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once supplanted by the market, Café in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a stylish cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came from his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people claimed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But when New York is changing, it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor table, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained many things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb used the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same bulbs from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in former times and regularly visited the verb.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairies usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hairies are only given up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five meter long animal accelerates on a steep 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein comments on the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist presumed to be stone-old for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hairies are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion, they measured six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt down the sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the Arctic Sea and look for cadaver, which torments from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hairies, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 cm was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the sharks nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search exacerbated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal, with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hairies, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 concentrations in their nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long shark-shark, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">That should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalites live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," "" "said the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The minions from the pastoral care unit Eyefal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, travelled to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were tackled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romatic journey of all the registrants in two years, the St. Anna's primary round of ministries is determined to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Reverend Storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim-Cruces and divided the Pilgrim-saws.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Inserer loving wife is standing and so the pilgrim's path started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field cruise, chapels or churches always rushed to sing together a song from a specially created pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after, one entered St. Peter's stage, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, at first about 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met at the Freiburg cathedral in the later afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God thanked God with a little impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, the Minis of the operator Markus Obert, which arrived at the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raged to fame during the last evening in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor roller, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed his home to win a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they scored a modest sixth place at the London railroad World Championships in London in spite of his resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that now has unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, there was a hint that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels with all the UK flags on the stands like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've got so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win over again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for the British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which continues tomorrow and ends, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and mobbing-reproaches as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company has distributed.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision to grant no further subsidies to operate the plant in Victoria at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the system of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, it could lead to domino effects, as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting shop, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting shop of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, which is owned by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting facility," "" "announced the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should come into effect from November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL believes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt" "" "or to ensure the power supply to the enamel" "" "does not affect" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt company in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analyst statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans of Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), a critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This constitutes the cliché act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacre brought the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris has to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's great sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold-selling edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an image band as a fashion journal, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising) from the 832 pages of the tome.</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine still seep prior to official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities who modelate" as "models, who are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though it's all true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners don't like success for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the Mistresses of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were flashing up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the mischievous seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures from Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without lifting the decision of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "Queensland Joint Research Centers are chronically underfinanced, which means thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent, meaning that thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Generalbundesprosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice as well as Senators from Queensland George Brandis to promptly raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">His successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was also not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, that would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came to stores just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as" "" "office in Western media format" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could set a lot for that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, albeit agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price for a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled in Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market dominates suppliers, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online anywhere and everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected such conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly rotated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its tagon-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected of planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, created some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>

<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete had almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have been known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle course in Silwia Daniova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the already critically informed athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires Chen full cooperation in the studies," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of the athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news broke through the positive rehearsal at Dankovowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the banned substance should act as an EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Daniova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already had a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov informed himself promptly with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the event "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz was tested three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the ingestion, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the Daniova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF had forbidden the whole Russian crew except for systematic doping, even the Kenya country produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the course of swimming, the previous violations in China also ensured violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">For example, Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkering purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the centre of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and respect for doping scams," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">During the Chinese championships, Sun was positively tested for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014, but only had to sit down for a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mystery Chronicles: betrayals of Love</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware use targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware anti-malware specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to expend ransom is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently witnessing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski talking to the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators found blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred in recent months frightening fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files like Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the endkey code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of stagnation in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their victims by chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decode sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively high risk gains from the ransomware extortion hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware-kits have been created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then search for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the underground forums, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually criminals employ spammers with spreading," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on them to be able to repel ransomware via file backup and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not enough threat to successful revenue, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing speculation," "" "says Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the con conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">It sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems small, the passengers have plenty of room both in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top falls down somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a trunk of 453 l for raised and 1026 l in folded back rests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">His work is likely to be a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is very gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the security systems is the city emergency brake assistant (operates up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart control bar responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway interbringer</seg>
<seg id="2">It stumps up regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal regulation is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car-racers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic on the surrounding road when they travel via the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Weseler Road by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic forks early, thus improving the overall flow of life on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys motorists above all between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Weekdays are enough to reach the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason for this is the coniferous eye on B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here the traffic is guided only one lane by the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back in three-fourths years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb two-lane heavy traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the interconnected traffic congestion continue, the responsible state company cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: the bridge has an official service life up to 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you don't think about sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults has sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rather than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons for them, says Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and through-sleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just falling asleep will feel many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is often common in depression," "" "says Wedel." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, have a herniated disc, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder over everyday problems and worries, there's a trial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Pill Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasises the lack of medical examiners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems with your sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in sleep lab doctors, for example, advise doctors in snoring with respiratory failure, in case of abnormal fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After disguising, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping end at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The process counts: regular sleeping and upsetting times, not lying too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcoholic and not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="3">Civilian investigators from the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden baths, in between still a rest of the cobblestone pavement: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like at first glance, but the police belong to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a newly-painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished shortly, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin interior senator Henkel has voted for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew-cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unidentified home owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are primarily irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority police protection from the vacant left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, the Berlin interior senator and the police between the squatters and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under large police orders in a regular street battle many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people, who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and polls from all over the world. residents from East Germany and former home squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them in the discarded discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury are according to statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make factions that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house near the 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the Riga city.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rīga street - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to it that the residents get back home: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of the time suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former buildings that supplant the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people tend to live here that are not so well worned," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of people who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone pulling in a pub area, can complain poorly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the carving wool of wool, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking but rather on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a deflected wool-milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has fixed a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika is supporting German and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear local authority.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In reality the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not working to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be reclocked, as it is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-Euro-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fumbed or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do not do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach will not work, and be unprofitable, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people in which nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the most recent incidents, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer, clearly," "" "what some might call naive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely revoiced.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So basic and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is elucidated by this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to hire them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already at full capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
