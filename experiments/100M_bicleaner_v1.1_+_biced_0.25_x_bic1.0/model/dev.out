Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting was intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and rej@@ ecting Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the choice of Israel that was at that time .
in an emergency call Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told him with a slightly sha@@ ky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Po@@ lic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal distress call at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced the students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; to whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence due to health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the escape from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs trail later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had been friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ ity before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening there were about 900 people attending the Cle@@ vel@@ and Delta State Campus , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after having shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss categ@@ orized as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workforce for Christmas
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products retail@@ er says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it was planned to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 employees were hired during the 2014 Holiday Season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me that I &apos;m a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , together with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the General Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims Tr@@ ump will likely win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising herd of Cain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump Core Proc@@ esses and start dropping their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben @-@ Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans do not see the raising of the anne@@ x as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , N@@ BC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , says ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their hil@@ ly hats , Republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten , Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can view campaign campaigns as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sm@@ ashed almost everyone .
some experts point out that the shat@@ tered area is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump management while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority of support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben @-@ Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was the starting point of the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will retain critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on matters of immigration .
so long as the immigration is in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben @-@ Car@@ son account for half the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ pless . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um with a view of the North Sea area .
in the street one square meter of a that@@ ched roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student house in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living venues , however , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here .
champions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double door@@ man in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to the FC Bayern in the wit@@ ch@@ craft of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic Games in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is scheduled to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller won the Champions League for the Bavarian Tour at the Champions League for the kind help of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a f@@ lange of the world champion &apos;s deliber@@ ate shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his recent six home games in the top class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here in 2011 .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but often in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts to works .
the attacks were initiated too often by shifting on left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck to the right than his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
initially , Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the pol@@ ka &apos;s header from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct connection , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ed with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could bet needle @-@ bites .
but Tor@@ wart Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero only gave the green light after completing the final training session , said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; anyone who wants to do something else is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler set another one .
before the game , it was in the stadium at Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partially wor@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with blows against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : if you don &apos;t , the risk will sink rapidly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , the DI@@ f@@ E emphasizes .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said studies manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health through to the age of old age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by lack of tim@@ el@@ essness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the department of Archae@@ ological floor preservation care .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to remnants of the fortress and the church tower , also a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered , probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to raise the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that essentially corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström , Commissioner responsible for the EU , at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP is said to be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new European Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are said to have come from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ections to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court in accordance with its own specifications .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , by the companies to pay damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , to negotiate national laws or to enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was pointed out above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , den@@ ounced the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform of the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
it remains unclear when talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ sic and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in their homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
released in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ence at any time .
the rum@@ or is that Mich@@ igan was the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , who lives in New York , returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece has been published in 2005 .
convincing in ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the most influential music media in the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic copies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still very orchest@@ rated , yet carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
from long time to the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and a large fluor@@ esc@@ encing stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here now nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays only a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally ends up with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly anticipated at the Prime Minister &apos;s lap .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ction Round and made his debut with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance from the media is likely to be examined and the Labour MPs from the proximity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip several meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday , prov@@ okes criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in dis@@ respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questioning is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the Shadow of Economic Policy , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &quot; theatre , often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , it was viewed by the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound became brit@@ tle according to data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to that , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result excluding bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the quick@@ est and best estimate since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index reached an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for Luxury Goo@@ ds Rich@@ em@@ ont - 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - posted growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper corporation Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his valuation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear business had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages threaten expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster under@@ scores Lebanese h@@ ue idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it goes both - and in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , that the Ol@@ denburg @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster in a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was that the Lebanese man has meanwhile registered in the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
that &apos;s why Al@@ hay wants to betra@@ y as much meat and as much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Ground Stand@@ ing Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - Immig@@ ration
Met@@ ris attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch from an al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor standing campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and sells shop owners who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for close to 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that after opening its first markets Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , could cost about 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash gains market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash rejected it to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt while printing on revenues and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , is resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurbish@@ ment programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special Kiss , &quot; got into the spotlight because of the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the ump@@ ire , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp enti@@ ced a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated somewhat too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s worked hard , he &apos;s good in form , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on competition rather than all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made the climb very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border as hundreds of immigrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a country strip along the road between the two control points of the lands and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants gu@@ iled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Serbian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary did not , however , put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities additional powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprisonment at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and have become the entrance point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in opposition to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence constructed along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities wanted 45 people to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed under the new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to get there .
around 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he has opted for the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to which candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big lead in the older constitu@@ ents .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the country &apos;s prim@@ aries say they would support Clinton if nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s backing to Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned by Clin@@ tons supporters .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ gesti@@ bility are also quoted .
since the vice president raises potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clin@@ tons supporters say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decided not to nom@@ inate the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate has emerged as unacceptable to these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in the elec@@ torate of their party &apos;s prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best performing at the three candidates for hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den in line with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s questions are still being made using a personal email address and server during the term as foreign minister , most of the Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions in all .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views became worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters across the country see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes in leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS news / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic drop in support for the two candidates .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support plat@@ former nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin governor Scott Walker , who is the deepest and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is entering the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising over the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tr@@ ump faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a fatal ritual in a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during a launch ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and re@@ port@@ edly waited for an hour before bringing him to hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of offensive attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to blame the persons involved but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the pet will be shaken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came after the first rate of interest within only 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase the interest rates but rather for the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset yields will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what is going on after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the infl@@ ating cycle and the return on return is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent in 2015 , few anticipate that this will continue , and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are very quickly put in the shadow after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds the yields appear to change the direction as soon as the initial increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the infl@@ ating cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to conver@@ ging between longer and shorter bond issues and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans tend to yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve has increased , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
large and large companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will get worse since an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points , with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising amount of dollars .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; European Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , argues a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly cannot be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director denied the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I consider the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to do is to engage the audience than it did in the past because the Br@@ its were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was &quot; produced in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee counter for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose to slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest income since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down the issue in November
for more than a decade virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August represented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with only five percent in comparison with the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales rose up three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some merchants web sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could with@@ hold buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent spending a little over £ 1 online .
some products , such as television and washing machines , are now carried out over a third of purchases via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the city centers .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead bodies are carried by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed to Mek@@ ka &apos;s grandfather .
gri@@ eving filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay her respect when the first of the dead approached the last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ved cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on the holy site , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family caused a san@@ ction due to the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 men who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mo@@ c@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane was supporting .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already firmly said that the H@@ add@@ ess will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , issued by the Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden Group is co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the wre@@ ath that r@@ ushed into a courtyard of the grand mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ add@@ ess that takes place later this month .
the bin Laden Group did not disclose any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because they did not co @-@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround the Mek@@ ka large mo@@ cha as part of the massive project managed by the Bin @-@ Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi Arabian family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crane collap@@ sed amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered 1 million Ri@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other verses receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss claims that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British occupied increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increased
this will lead to the opening of 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , king@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its have their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , according to the company &apos;s boss after B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , offering services on low prices , has meanwhile out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops selling professional tra@@ des@@ people and closing 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions were taken by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still a majority of men in our branch offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .

officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt regional court , two officials of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants used money from club accounts that they could disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage will be estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the alle@@ gation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials only paid expense allowance and the sports club , for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then , we stood in front of the situation : do we keep the club further or block it ? &quot; one of the accused , in the bread @-@ making profession , said a large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial sector .
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the receipt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in the case of financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance had been agreed retro@@ actively by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , flat and not detailed entries appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
the accounts and not@@ aries divided the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial debt , it is important to have been only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when investigations started in 2011 against the official investigations , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants .
this account ran on the name of the second accused and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repar@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a c@@ ents salary , he only calculated mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
on diets , he charged the association € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to prove accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were no longer kept , after a audit in which everything had been judged correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second accused .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , so that he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard delivers another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been ongoing for three years , Compu@@ Tr@@ ese will replace more jobs with the company &apos;s split@@ ting up .
the extensions of the US computer H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion are to be saved ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share continued to be 2.3 percent tra@@ ded on the market .
headquartered in Pal@@ o Alto , California , the company with printers from California is currently being split into a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services continued to be the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the quarter , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus , revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers with split@@ ting and massive extensions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more shops just online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would overwhel@@ m the majority : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed to agree .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad ref@@ utes 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 percent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the heart of the fair .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility meets &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the International Motor Show on Saturday .
like two years ago , the organizers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect about 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke T@@ rän@@ eng@@ as and water thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that a police line had formed and a water thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials .
the officials initially set off pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokesman of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves if the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion , that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will wait a little longer and that the interest rates remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est relies on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky view of global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague again on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency center that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I am so sorry that I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , escaped on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as its curriculum vit@@ ae on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around the world
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 senior executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evaluating the low @-@ budget Euro@@ wings .
the airline &apos;s aim of real@@ ig@@ ning is a contribution to earnings of some € 500 million a year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Euro@@ wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap airline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be developed as independent as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in future , the executive team led by Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ffs with the Pilot Association of cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations shall be resum@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , cockpit would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fastest possible results &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa will be loc@@ ating routes to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own cheap line .

Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to tears and ruled it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ f@@ ess escape .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom champion has an additional incentive to recover by the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg breach when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the web site of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , re@@ stores an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears the local environment rav@@ aged by the monetary gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fied , Th@@ ought knit@@ ting Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , pur@@ p@@ ous nature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally threatened by expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in batch placement , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der leaves and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully suggests other Yor@@ k@@ shire &apos;s runs , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man .
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him , while Nick comp@@ ost got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of having mos@@ ques beside Cook had what an extra sp@@ in Bow@@ ler would perform and four Qui@@ cks would get , appeared and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a critic of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred run@@ es straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Hab@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
collaboration team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain from the EU ) could win subsidies if the economy gets into a loud b@@ ang by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und recently stated that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
at their annual meeting in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided that it would not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European boy@@ friend , who wants an outside looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ time sever@@ ity like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a fade @-@ out force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may deliberately not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is supposed to be my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , as they did during the 1975 referendum , but did not support our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ins@@ an@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gues , telephone @-@ min@@ ating foreigners and the pseudo @-@ countries that most of our large newspapers possess .
Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you should better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he obj@@ ected to Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle rejected by the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , who opened a backdoor to him .
the press never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly clip on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste time - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the tw@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father worked on television to be il@@ legitimate to his Labour @-@ cabinet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ert &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports at their convention conference on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday about something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champions , some of which also include an industry finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the P@@ he tobacco directive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted beforehand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system two billion pounds per year .
through the clear preparation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former leader of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harsh controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 , without success , to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson of the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider to be a good idea in medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame , because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme could be funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I have to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series that headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for valu@@ ations due to the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ne@@ c programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they &apos;re going to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the commission : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also announced to the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its thi@@ an mission , &quot; inform , form and talk . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances enter alliances to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are aired with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
gour@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles , found it out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultra @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ oun@@ ds to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy compla@@ ining about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ exhau@@ sting to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : tell people where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand with regard to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ mite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
leave people .
people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and adjust their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room b@@ ypass culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the pinn@@ acle of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say themselves to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence hall ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to them , dis@@ connect and see them every day and perhaps see them coming across all common friends .
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , at least try to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good trick is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and enjoyable lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their fix@@ tures at the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ den is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of the corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need homes but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ den believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ den , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ lain : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great extent .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient housing for the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ ary : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different , if one puts people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ ders : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ den : I have been using my project correctly .
the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert of Sonder@@ bau and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance makes it particularly complicated .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig . ( translated with Google Translate )
it is still under@@ represented who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ es : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ more : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that hardly can afford to afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the hel@@ per .
I would like to show you how to build cheap and good things even today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght withdraw@@ s or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by installing the updates . it will also be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is completed .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly @-@ leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , knows just one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second also stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ world champion in front of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races so far and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the big price of Singapore is unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
as a result , it is possible to record players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ino@@ ft have joined the social foundation under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new focal point at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consultations , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has recently been opened .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and advice are immediately sent to questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years we have been committed to our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the benefits of the insurance companies are not rarely used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a business manager for the elderly , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Centre for Care and Care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both business executives especially in the demographic change .
because this is a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and good as possible in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thur@@ s@@ days from 4 am to 6 pm and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a quar@@ ry of no@@ stri@@ ls and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he left his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ rator re@@ treated the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove past demonstrations several times .
when one did not see the vehicle any more , the wounded went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
using a head@@ stick , one re@@ counts the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
so far , only a vag@@ ue work description is available .
one of the men was approximately 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been around 1.@@ 65 m tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice Fel@@ st@@ anders and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on October 12th , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the rock standing acquain@@ tance of Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their professional training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also want to get into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the tw@@ o@@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , followed his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz County and is involved in voluntary work of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen ( DRC ) .
from September 19th , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ owners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endos@@ copy comes out of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 euros will be given to the land@@ fill in the scope of a funding programme ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the Lord Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2,000 patients are employed in the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had found himself , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers Spe@@ aker &apos;s hour , by the way , continue to look first of all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medi@@ cs practi@@ sed for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel fel@@ steh@@ aus , smiling .
after the long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pushed for gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum claim can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this was the case for the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Slovenian wants to avoid its borders for refugees , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to arrive at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia on Tuesday to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has continuously interven@@ ed in police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country will host about 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would have diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said .
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day additional buses were expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Macedonia , about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said to us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention the details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on Serbian side there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is not yet clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high numbers of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet tell whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute land maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having reviewed yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the collected information , insi@@ der trading should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators were said to have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle around the Mannheim @-@ Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their concerns , partly quick pac@@ ing , partly cozy .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city run@@ ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life at stunning autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four big tables each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce drew attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some people spontaneously reach chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over and over again , there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me eventually the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public effective action is good for the 20 year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tables is understandable , but it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death is still covered with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an assessment of Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral atten@@ dant is one of the voluntary workers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported that she had been part of the company in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives are accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid is able to cope well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support provided by the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the pla@@ ques , described on Saturday , are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his earnings forecast for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share was more than 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts were expecting a total of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower view is despite the price increases , aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ land transport from heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year as a result of lowering costs , higher revenue and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid income if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ational employment were announced one day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex paid 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ a share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at T@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tization , which brought the turnover in his unit express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the bo@@ d@@ land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to € 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ story cour@@ tro@@ om is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled from the unprecedented incentive by the near zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes itself uncertain of the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition expected .
while job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constant under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the May summit .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion spark@@ ed del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that seem not to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aside aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Market Restru@@ c@@ turing Unit , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il didn &apos;t come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she &apos;s afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday it does it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole of other tuition is at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s Brazil pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects pregnant women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can ad@@ ver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new sports hall Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried has approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installations .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ able hall construction on the ward &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the last session of the Municipal Council the dra@@ fted construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the Panel had adopted an application for a structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a non @-@ central First and roof super@@ structure is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planning is the intended use of the roof@@ ing surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in turn , the roof ti@@ lt that is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the building plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the ti@@ lt of the roof did not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby Bern@@ ward &apos;s municipal council is usually rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are approximately 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the District Council for inspection .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision will be made to the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , including J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner ward .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be shut down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this in 2018 , when the currently ongoing refurbish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ack , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there were several considerations .
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference psychological iat@@ rist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer of the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and comprehen@@ sively understood by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure over the past decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .

Jag@@ ü@@ ll with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police reported .
after a shooting @-@ off , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old people from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has visited a victim of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police told on Wednesday .
as susp@@ icious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also arrested on Tuesday evening , who , in fact , admitted the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to a festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the event of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the arrest , the authorities admitted to the police interro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body in the Canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
information on the immediate circumstances of action shall bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of vulner@@ ability
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ cils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many people then stum@@ ble across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for the rent in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a residential deficit extending from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units were already missing in the metro@@ politan areas , according to Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities , not@@ ori@@ ously in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults only stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in recent years , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in large cities .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in the process , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
this could be wai@@ ved for the real estate tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats could be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters by state bank Kf@@ W already arrives well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros had been rec@@ alled .
now the project could be even increased .
refugees have free ra@@ ids : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer in transit because more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , virtually eliminates the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to let the refugees pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested in the morning the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town S@@ id both by bus and with taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet gren@@ ades .
for this the bor@@ der@@ line bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , little more refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing on Monday there had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences were sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly persons among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
but practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers started to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
locking gri@@ lles were disman@@ tled and one of the reception areas in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself the goal of this conversion .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still living in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees gathered regularly on foot .
mayor pit@@ ted on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing as suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we got the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snacks and drinks .
we have said the same thing , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .

that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has publicly acknowledged and publicly supported the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dun@@ ks of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to make decent conditions for protection seekers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the support of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word &apos;s weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first town centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shelter of the 20,000 refugees , which came to Austria on Monday , was also without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 establishments will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s fine in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be explained how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can easily provide accommodation .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the superior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in accommodation , Conrad explained with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man who doesn &apos;t say the truth without further ado . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees by three to four .
so far , the own district search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz challenges a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
the mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says that this is not necessary at the moment .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , additional locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the chief of the town chief is cri@@ tique of the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister , Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday accepted the further procedure in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available for the time being .
the protection @-@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the course of the Germans is that Austria again introduces itself to its borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Run@@ t@@ astic Is A Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refurbish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the listed IT Group S &amp; T is located in four of the six floors of the office and production building . the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the new yard of startup companies and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er is promising : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investment of 1.7 million euros was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2,@@ 700 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on ven@@ eer hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been thinking about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the metro@@ politan area that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought her mother to the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I am most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert also cannot answer with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ inv@@ ents every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
this feature also links to some billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself hostile , repor@@ ters , or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office will boost the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire comes from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ hair@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del directed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their kan@@ gar@@ oo style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump as well as the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the investors , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without approval , he had declared the director of the Institute of P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to start the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking say@@ ings of the descend@@ ant .
it had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Polish , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement seems to dis@@ soci@@ ate the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you think Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stadt that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t like the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ emaker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA w@@ akes up interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at most 2,500 residents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in Today &apos;s ratings .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the Executive Board did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise scored 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today reported a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August , Today reported an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 went .
until now , Sun@@ rise has 34@@ ,000 viewers on average at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ en@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without Raf@@ ael &apos;s star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , resulted in an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before three two , you may inad@@ vert@@ ently put a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips tightly to the final on Thursday
all three women have agreed in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby den@@ ies his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the destruction of the game , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called them - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I entered the house and noticed ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah has both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 a.@@ m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams looking for an impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ on for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly reinforced Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ on left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
all in all it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free elec@@ tors demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn show in Gros@@ wall@@ stadt if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of free elec@@ tors day by Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum refer@@ ees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Landes@@ politik in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall below the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , has launched the pilot test &quot; Mid @-@ level plus &quot; in which an extension of the secondary school level of three to four years is tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all grammar schools who want this .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Senior District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on the southern plains where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4,000 square meters in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have been signed accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , bought a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement near Em@@ den are located near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective customer , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ my company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the Urban Development Committee of the Council of the Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
for months , the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion .
the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction called forth strong reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like some other project critics , that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole buses must come in order to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a donation campaign that aims to raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees un@@ rolling the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / US dollars to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are fat@@ ally obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c le@@ aching - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at about 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % had the diabetes condition completely and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes only dissolved at one percent and partially in only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison with the gastro@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater dec@@ lines in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obesity was about 29 percent less likely to die over the age of 15 - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who were interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said without an increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of hand dis@@ infection by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swallow strong alcoholic hand @-@ infection agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of dis@@ infection of hand dis@@ infection in children under the age of 12 , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres reported , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are intentionally drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning particularly in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry @-@ fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally prescribed by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah gave her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the sign of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York plan@@ ed to poison their &quot; gem@@ m@@ ological &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the s@@ worn plan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of Celtic games any more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
you talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Swe@@ de swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swe@@ ars to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ ting out of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now standing at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ à said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel it exactly like this - but we have to go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need to really support Celtic because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
getting together is so important .

the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .

in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the rate of employment for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - an increase over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk troubled the drain
since security personnel were unable to bring peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a respir@@ ation alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 cream milk and remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late law intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will be able to observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she was &quot; able to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that publicity work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after a hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist was dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot; sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house of peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins .
Championship soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspir@@ ational locals came to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria integration department and claimed that she was conducting a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult circumstances when it came to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I then have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had left the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I would name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now reflect on it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse @-@ side , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been like yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday all day , which was also the case .
but it was the same on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against rival because of claims on ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites at the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; battle battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the ring .
Bell@@ amy champi@@ oned the torch of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches on his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real centre of gravity , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts - St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a ver@@ ge .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing , and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that in one phase we will still meet them .
the Storm Team got free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to get to the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released on a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a $ 200,000 security deposit in common to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ ther@@ ly declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , reports to the police every day and stops at an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driving cab apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the free@@ way 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three involved lor@@ ries had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ t used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his interviews with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confron@@ ting the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of having in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg did not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the judgment until October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases pending .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment day .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up by the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and arrest , many bad users increased the number of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
out of the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had access to the German side on foot via bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison with the week of the week on Wednesday , more refugees already arrived at the Munich central station .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest awaiting &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ mb@@ aro@@ es in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air currents now flow into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the prec@@ ur@@ sor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which in the past days was drawn from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to the DW@@ D , on Thur@@ s@@ days also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see rice with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the coaches show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry level below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will drive next to the new compact car next to the Astra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals , Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version .
he comes in the trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan booth wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in the spring of 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger placed first @-@ hand on the front end : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and was first integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authority Te@@ gel , who had been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country in Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and referred the case back to it again .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation , a compensation was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges often strengthened the rights of prisoners of pen@@ alties .
thus they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was confined naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel incident in November 2009 for decent housing .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell like the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights , it must have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what happens in Germany ?
according to statements by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , even if Germany is capable of absor@@ bing a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated his determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Office of Germany ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic above all in affordable rental objects : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price are falling annually , and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and for this the federal government should invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
scholars and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany will be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas in the past there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit the asylum seekers to a residential area .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled staff , it has become increasingly clear that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
so far there is no adequate supply of general and job @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often conve@@ yed through personal contacts .
the establishment of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Royal Road to the Integration of Labor .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ etter , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased greatly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes .
they are not always instructed by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only qualify for qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ acker from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or cul@@ tured the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
Studi@@ er@@ wil@@ lig refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or tolerance do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start a course of studies .
the latter basically receive no b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall below the circle of the b@@ af@@ o@@ g@@ entitled persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be b@@ af@@ o@@ g @-@ justified , from January 1 , 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should gradually introduce the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic ch@@ arities association who takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
rights are also part of the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to master against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to train such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society much more today than today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , forcing the exploitation of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general gender equality law for a decade .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and interest groups non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention of Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that are expected so far , says Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be invested in the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is required to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers .
the services rendered could later be deduc@@ ted with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum seekers employment law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , doctors make the language barriers particularly difficult .
as early as so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are becoming more informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in hospitals , even in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ting costs should be taken over , she demands .
however , many refugees would have helped many refugees even with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities in refugee camps , and with the young people it &apos;s about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with some of the other illnesses , German doctors come from their education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the lack of doctors , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and vom@@ it again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill following estimates from the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable to inf@@ ring@@ ing refugee children .
a recent study by the Munich University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
so far only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can apply for a psycho@@ therapy application in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege asks for dreams
with the new staging &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to capture every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the Bri@@ ck@@ les of Bri@@ ck@@ les invites to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to spiritu@@ alists is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural cocktail with a world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces by talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , it wants to pick up the Cuban duo .
ease and agi@@ lity - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides the numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with delic@@ acy and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an , no problem .
slim people are fascinating and frigh@@ tening at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t go well with our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be picked up by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid giant jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there is something for every visitor to be there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 people , we always give our best and are with it whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place between 17 and 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions the wrong speech in parliament
MR Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the case of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
last month , they had booked it out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the affected parliament members that immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto gar@@ ages called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PC to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his history his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the high season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no longer matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have experienced most of the vulner@@ ability stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a temporary period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and to indul@@ ge the players who need it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to move forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the greatest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where 3,@@ 2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on men friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends has hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the soccer game in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a co @-@ worker of telep@@ hon@@ y said : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ angers me really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the fully re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria is making his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who took the French master on his way , but after that they missed a series of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ h@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not achieve one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , he passed to Johan Wil@@ and passed the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off beating Celtic in a play @-@ off , joined An@@ c@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy enemy .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pp post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some patches of fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ opped in the first half in not less than five tries and then quit after having used him after re@@ starting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which turned Di Maria into a shoot that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ ans therefore scored his sixth part of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an outstanding intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi met a goal in the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola changed to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obvious a few years ago just before Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion league winner , twice champion of Europe , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona 24 years old and moved to Qatar to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he already stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and registered also by FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ sman took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on downloads diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the cast of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direction rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that the direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 vi@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter scored nationwide and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured halt .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Prize , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports climbing and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which finished just off their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d think about it any res@@ ent@@ ment .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt like if they had di@@ pped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers passing Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins past
mint PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins applied a chance to asc@@ end within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card space .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year severely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at each game in the bull@@ pen and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle @-@ Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the leading 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
after adding a Insurance run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Detroit put an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed player , however , made S@@ ano three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
at the start of the game , Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the offen@@ ding list after having lack@@ ed more than a month because of a back@@ rest .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch coun@@ tdown , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ able right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns on six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , which has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the offen@@ ding list to fight the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a gu@@ essing in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective ways of jour@@ ne@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also complain .
but those who do not have a lead perspective cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of strength &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could also be secured with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from looking for alternatives to Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had a@@ verages the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the Saturn p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus there is a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; space prob@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its way around the ring plane .
although this movement is small but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 Cass@@ ini had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ies water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a rob@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an in@@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain plenty of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor Beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
thus , those who eat the fruit supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some salads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .

like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys until Thursday morning , spor@@ adi@@ cally and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance to the neighbouring middle @-@ country and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now known as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were able to live only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the square , in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time as a forgotten sin@@ ner ba@@ bel .
according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses on aband@@ on@@ ment .

Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updates Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 subjects formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he has been fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible @-@ quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cords are golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on it , and perhaps also to bear me with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is sup@@ planted there .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , Klaus Alt@@ mu@@ ost had always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but rather chose the mysterious themes that were important for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching
plans made , place found , companies commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ oning , especially among residents who did not want the train to endure .
so hills scre@@ ened , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was made in October , the first Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the situation to be sharpen@@ ed in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems at hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation intensively in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive turning point must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have assured the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set out a clear sign when they will bear the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sponsor@@ en@@ logos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can take advantage of our jet power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Chief Executive Officer lo@@ oses an eye in case of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , was im@@ potent , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager at the meeting was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was top@@ pled by the wheel .
he therefore arrives at night races in Singapore on the weekend just as little as a reservation driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired about a week later at the Great Prize of Japan .
Szen@@ tim@@ re@@ fal@@ va : Cot@@ tag@@ ge with huge land at the edge of the village
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper position .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master keeper Roman Tran@@ sylvania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe @-@ League games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les has left open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ en@@ sic statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final turn for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League will be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl agrees : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday at Frankfurt Motor Show at the IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being built on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be br@@ ushed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make an international contribution to the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study &apos;s authors estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the Dec@@ ra test organization , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 percent believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es reck@@ on up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the USA .
in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey by digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the free@@ way , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic jams .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double kick at table tennis - Euro
the Düsseldorf @-@ based company wants to hit the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , only in sing@@ les .
the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title also without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the EM course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the score list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo had also lack@@ ed and we became Europe champions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should therefore ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football national player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached earlier , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition was a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed complete art work for which much effort was carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to information provided by the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers of 14 tons of material were car@@ pet@@ ed to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ès &apos;s old ted@@ dy bear can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ni@@ cal , fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents .
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they did not get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener head as fashion niche
in the past , it was time for the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in large quantities for customers , who used them for example for ceilings and she@@ ers .
this is no longer valid today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bor@@ rowed from past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they account for half of all orders .
mo@@ dest@@ y P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they can bear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , currently to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association seeks to score points , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design often only varies slightly to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine stops small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with a traditional P@@ lau@@ ener head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s head - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to share a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of its classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not a new movie but a kind of continuation playing 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI drives to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was entrusted with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to take up private capital , and over@@ haul the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment will be identified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important because it acc@@ esses the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and is more open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also ease checks on powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predat@@ ory fishing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish@@ eries and to exploit the consumer a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf &apos;s mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold based on the existing limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to Food@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller gra@@ p@@ ples , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values however that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock spent more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively crossed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
