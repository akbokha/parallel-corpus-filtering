II ) That the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for the duration of the non @-@ application of the safety measures in accordance with this Convention .
( B ) The organisation and the community agree that the safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards will not be applied .
in any case , the safety measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement are once again applied as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held on the current account of the total quantity and composition of this material in the country concerned or in the States concerned and on any sharing of such material from this state or of these states .
this explains its agreement as soon as possible ; it only extends to matters such as time and proced@@ ural provisions and arrangements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or under secret protection of the military activity and does not refer to the successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs each of them grow in carrying out their obligations under this Agreement .
if the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their territorial power , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special search for the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has agreed beforehand in advance .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the In@@ spec@@ tors of the Organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , on the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as on the nationals of the states .
any claim that the community or the state has in relation to the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or a State due to damages - with the exception of any damage from a nuclear incident that arose from carrying out the safety measures following this agreement , is regulated in accordance with international law .
if the Council , after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , states that the organization is not able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to col@@ lateral or other nuclear missi@@ les after this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in article X@@ II ( C ) of the stat@@ ute and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied safety measures , offers the community or the state - as far as each of the parties involved is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to ask that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes related to the conclusion of the Council after Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiating path or another procedure agreed upon by the Organization , Community and States shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states name two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four appointed arbit@@ rators choose a fifth that leads the presi@@ dency .
if the community and the states or the organization have not designated two arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the Organization shall seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the arbit@@ rators are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the Organization , the Community and the States concerned .
( a ) This Convention enters into Non @-@ nuclear power states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the concerned state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) if the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures relating to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other upon request of one of the Parties to am@@ end this Convention .
( B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on preventive measures .
the objective of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is timely detection of the dis@@ junction of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such dis@@ junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material sample zone the quantity of material not specified for a specified period is specified , speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified quantities .
in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization makes after Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their safegu@@ ards , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following nature , and as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it is intended and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of the core material and the amounts of stock ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures to evaluate the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a reporting and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the one and exit of the material balance zone ;
g ) arrangements to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 @-@ 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures following this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Ret@@ ur@@ ns core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or the core material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in the Convention .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met , the Community shall not be able to obtain or request the recovery of core material , which is subject to preventive detention according to this Convention , for the time being , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided the organization and the Community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the safety measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the Organization free of core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , fre@@ es from these safegu@@ ards , provided the entire core material set free in the states for this Article in the states is not at any time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special cle@@ av@@ age material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or there@@ under ;
should the core material be processed , processed or stored together with the core material subject to the safety measures following this agreement , provisions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures will be made on that material .
the community meets with the Organisation for Supp@@ le@@ mentary Agre@@ ements , which are required in the scope that is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in individual as to how to apply the procedures established in the Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of the agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires a connection between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summary inventory of the core material underlying this agreement in the states , not@@ withstanding its origin , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigation .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other hand
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution done by the Member States within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; Inter@@ action Account , &quot; which consists of the funds authorised by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the account will be separate and separate from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds of the member state , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the respective State in order of the organization as the administrator of the special account and to be deposited at the organization &apos;s deposit in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely , the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed between the E@@ EC and the ste@@ ward taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may , upon request , make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
the Administrator , in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , takes a proportion@@ ate draw on the cash or credit card to cover expenses for the special loan and to balance the account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any recurring loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral scheme ) , which is independent of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices which are to be taken into account for the purpose of this agreement ( letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Inter@@ action Comp@@ are must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which are tied in the context of a loan or loan for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
in addition to Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally considered for the organization granted by the organization ; therefore they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that it retains .
a special loan is to be issued through a separate loan agreement between recipient country and the administrator in which particular the source of the funds is given .
the recei@@ pts from any lending officer can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to the scope of what the administrator specified at the time of the loan guarantee , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special loan are based on the special account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC to the complete allocation of all the special loans to the E@@ EC via the projects and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for review by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker shares the E@@ EC &apos;s quar@@ terly report on the development of the special loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the ba@@ ili@@ ff tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the completion of the fiscal year of the organization an extensive billing of the special account with a statement of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this statement of accounts .
after full payment of the special loan , the E@@ EC administrator will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the F@@ TT as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special account , the amounts paid out of the account , and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States are evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special account from time to time , lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the special interest account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions , and on any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organisation could possibly reconci@@ le , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are invalid .
if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and referred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States shall note the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch languages , with each wor@@ ding equal to binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make an appropriate application .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion financial units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
right now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without leaving for a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a bill of loans .
moreover , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S used at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the appropriate margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb .
I commend myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations both parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled lamb , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons expressed in car@@ c@@ ass @-@ weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to take care that the access to Argentina &apos;s regulated access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in case the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amount in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .

the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here@@ with the ho@@ ech@@ st rate of exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 is taken into account .
the total amount so @-@ called number 2 is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tonnes of car@@ tons .
the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development that could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community is meeting provisions for the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ists in frozen meat as a result of the regulation of the regulation , not under@@ mining the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine rab@@ ble and lamb .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agree that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb , as well as of slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , takes place only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees that this agreement is observ@@ able in particular by issuing export lic@@ ences stipul@@ ated in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the Community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the presentation of an export license issued by the relevant authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details for the application of this system are specified in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
in terms of implementing provisions , it is also specified that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority publishes the quantities in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be en@@ coded according to country of destination .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and runs smoothly .

the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement is not adver@@ sely affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are executed under the agreement of non @-@ specified tari@@ ff @-@ numbers according to the Community .
the committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount determined by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes into account the seasonal nature of the trade .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat
I call on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation concerning a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb &apos;s meat after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal passage of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - Fresh or ch@@ illed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will be ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from access to the community &apos;s market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ bs is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the annual amount actually executed does not exceed the set amount .
the pre @-@ defined amounts are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community market .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trading , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amount , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the Community is obliged to limit exhaus@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts set in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand &apos;s trade with each new Member State .
in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty .
the total amount stated in clause 2 is set with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ tons .
the community under@@ takes everything to prevent a market development that could compromise the normal section of the New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ bs on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community holds provisions for not under@@ mining the sales of inter@@ vention@@ ists in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation .
in addition , the two contracting parties do everything to promote the consumption of creative work in the community without risk of market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agree that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb , as well as of slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts specified in clause 2 in particular in the fact that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .

a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all blood samples tested , containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest Ser@@ um th@@ inners in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely in the volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles which are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions associated with ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture inside a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood type determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin ) O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory ability test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date given on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed in such a way that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of not more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .

the re@@ agents for the determination of blood type determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally d@@ yed as far as possible for international exchange , at least as long as there has not been an international agreement about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the volume in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and control of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are stored as long as possible from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents can not contain substances of human origin .
a black on white printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
