this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . cervical thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to initiate or use the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works primarily as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize brain activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurrence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and resor@@ ption of resor@@ ption ( intake ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reduced in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled strain ) , tre@@ mor ( permanent urge ) , tre@@ mor ( sleep@@ iness ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefit of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. permission to transport A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes attached to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no higher risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tonic disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy show signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be deposited .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and addressing for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ic , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) can be observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is to be expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metaboli@@ tes , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ der metaboli@@ tes .
considering the joint administration of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
following the release of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose prior to start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ ous ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this medicine may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and the concerns raised in the reproductive @-@ studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ema , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with ar@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ cin@@ ol@@ us therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,@@ 3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another 12 weeks study , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ or kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
adverse events reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks for healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % of placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ta@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ages over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superi@@ ority compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a preserving effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , compared to placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in exten@@ der metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the detri@@ ment of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sul@@ fate metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of ape , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for the delivery of single doses of aluminium into folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets .
15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , compared to placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
27 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , compared to placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
39 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , compared to placebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , rigi@@ dity , alternating levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ ta@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superi@@ ority compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ theless , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sul@@ fate metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
bili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the drug characteristics to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melted tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for intake .
there are no studies on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
tests on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ p@@ tive or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tonic disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ic , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) can be observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which a healthy test subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15@@ mg dose ) were administered intra@@ muscular and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metaboli@@ tes can result in common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
following the release of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose prior to start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole gift .
the following adverse events were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another 12 weeks study , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
adverse events reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed with respect to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression @-@ rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ta@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study program in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , the study showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first two hours of intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % higher than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in@@ tra @-@ muscular in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , no safety concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sul@@ fate metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine earlier .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in only some administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated patients responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel chemotherapy .
if one considers only patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it must also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or low in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that , in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , it was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy type 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose changes in patients with kidney function impair@@ ment ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in patients no further treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils is increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated car@@ dio @-@ toxic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if , after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , nausea , vomiting , and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients , they may be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm con@@ serving , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect transport efficiency and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects , which were performed in combination with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent which promotes the pooling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ m@@ aries and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ i@@ theli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ receptor and , due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ connected studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of the patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the treatment of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active agents ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular spread and / or soft tissue integration of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared with the IV @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent @-@ containing Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) after the abrasion @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma the mean value of the untreated total dose was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and , like other potentially toxic substances , should be handled with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an abra@@ x@@ ane water bottle .
after full en@@ core of the solution , the through@@ flow bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for the placing on the market supplies the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . • Ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ation boxes for transport through the patient with clear visual representation of the correct application of the product .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood @-@ blood @-@ values , in which complications can occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if an own blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with the stre@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make their own blood donation , the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed has to be inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be controlled before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ sin@@ amed was compared to the reference medicinal product .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected into a vein at least eight weeks before they either received either stre@@ amed stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ kr@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between the weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of stre@@ se@@ amed inj@@ ected under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ kr@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were amed to the retina were maintained to the same degree as those receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ kr@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ kr@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
stre@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the European Union regulations , it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ kr@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ sin@@ amed is providing information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , in case of blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , the amed stre@@ amed stre@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency in adults who have a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and fol@@ lic@@ as may vary depending on age , sex , and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients occasionally individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels can be observed via or under the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10@@ g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and subsequent manifest@@ ations may vary depending on age , sex , and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10@@ g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ pro@@ cal cy@@ te count by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reci@@ pro@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ pro@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l is increased three times a week , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the reci@@ pro@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an appeal to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , which require the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ges@@ tions , should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
on this occasion , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circul@@ atory system .
patients suffering from ar@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral vascular disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the rec@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the ti@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ sin@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins , if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , and the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who may have to be trans@@ coded ) for evaluating the effectiveness of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the goal of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly if possible before epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist for patients with an initial residual current of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been shown to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ mal thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations for th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically acquired epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate portion , identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo controlled studies and progression @-@ free progression .
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , an@@ a@@ emia treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an an@@ a@@ emia consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality compared to controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours for healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose applied to men , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fö@@ tal@@ em body weight , a delay of the os@@ ci@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the Member States , the holder of the agency &apos;s approval has to provide the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Medical training brochure • summari@@ zing the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging .
the owner of the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and functioning before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine applied to the market is applied .
the holder of the Marketing Auth@@ ori@@ zation approval is obliged to conduct the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Sche@@ dule and to update the Risk Management Plan in accordance with each subsequent review of the Risk Management Plan .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
furthermore , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • maintaining new information that could have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important mile@@ stones ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction concerned )
• Have a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment - if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a blood cl@@ ots have occurred before you
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed treatment , there may be a slight rise in the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which results in further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed prior to treatment .
after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin was reported very rarely about the occurrence of an an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with stre@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ sin@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may involve the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
if you suffer from elevated or asc@@ ending potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with the stre@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium levels fall back to normal levels .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion symptoms due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the time available , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge with stre@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood levels ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your fl@@ amed dose appropriately to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed down very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in case you are cancer patient , keep in mind that stre@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances can have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment .
if your values of red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high you should not receive the fl@@ amed stre@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other drugs or have recently taken / used drugs , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ und@@ amed , your doctor will , if necessary , arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you receive regular dos@@ ages between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success rate and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash the stre@@ se@@ amed himself beneath the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , strokes , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ mbo@@ sis , retinal vas@@ cul@@ ature , and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin therapy .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ ometers was used to assess Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was studied .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was studied .
Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) has been reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those of placebo .
comparing all patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 out of 1 0@@ 65 ) versus 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures .
the Patient Information package is to be provided and include the following key messages : • Supp@@ ression in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures .
for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ yl@@ ation the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by adding acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) are not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data for safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be examined before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients need@@ ing dental interventions , no data is available , whether the dis@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates treatment reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
a very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ ine cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the placebo and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ in within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
all patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following a recently frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as red@@ dening , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been studi@@ ous , especially for cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the event of over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % lower risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar in@@ flu@@ oric acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the neck lower by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were collected one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the basin comb .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to placebo , an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ alities were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the Ac@@ la@@ sta group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times .
for more than 24 months , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo , and 4.3 % on the th@@ igh@@ s .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior compared to the one @-@ week administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been proved in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain effects was observed after 6 months compared to the starting value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study could maintain the therapeutic response of 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the pulmon@@ ary cycle with half @-@ life hours t ½ β 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β @-@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a prolonged elimination phase with a termin@@ ale exclusion period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ values ) probably represent rapid resor@@ ption in bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to a 30 % reduction in zinc concentration at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because it is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
the result is that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the t@@ oll@@ ed acid .
since severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ recurring intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was determined in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ sep@@ tic effect of the substance .
in rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity of dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the low serum calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

Ris@@ co @-@ Management Plan The owner of the Marketing Auth@@ ori@@ zation approval ple@@ dges to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance that are offered in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and of all the following CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine for risk management systems for medicinal products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
an over@@ worked R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is a substance class representative called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get mor@@ bus , bone breakdown takes place too quickly , and new bone material is formed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by restoring the bone structure to normal , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forces the strength of the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are using drugs known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and beverages , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will receive enough fluids before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please make your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or jaw@@ s were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ yl@@ ation frac@@ tures , Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended for two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture require an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
compli@@ a is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over and / or overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for the placement of smoking compared to a placebo .
the studies on the attitude of smoking did not show any consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
the most common side effects of accompli@@ sh@@ ments observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it can also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts to a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

it also contributes to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , who also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in individual cases out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur .
relatives or other close collabor@@ ators must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

5.3 Evi@@ dence of clinical data for the safety of the following adverse events not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals following exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over an extended period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , allowing recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no adverse effects on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not lead to changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl di@@ ure@@ a or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic res@@ n or insulin can be maintained with start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic res@@ ins or the insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making Type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos reduced the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the ple@@ bis@@ therapy study , the effects of Ac@@ tos added to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa resin in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos can not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit to transport Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available to use Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. a heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used in patients with high @-@ output h@@ ep@@ atic cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes must be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme parameters must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be conducted by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been submitted .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been identified , which can stem from fatty deposits and , in some cases , is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two or three @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , we reported a decrease in visual acuity under treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , an incidence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture response was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a reference medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ tate .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interaction of drugs have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from available data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range were comparable to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups with met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on respectively .
since its launch , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has rarely been reported about heart failure , but more commonly when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients was conducted in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with reference medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ tate .
if the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , followed by 180 mg / day for seven days , no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect was evaluated ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the therapy started , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was not adequately adjusted in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin were random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the mean h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials for one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was studied in a small , 18 @-@ week study on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced overall plasma matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase of L@@ DL cholesterol in Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas reduced values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about the effect of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups receiving either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination rate of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting from the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ s resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ onic tumors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture response was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a reference medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ tate .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d respectively .
in clinical trials for more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the initial values .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about the effect of Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ alities , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and leg ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular risk risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use the insulin .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were significantly lowered as compared to another insulin analog .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to in@@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ re@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is included in the package ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes over the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage to be required .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in patients , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which passes through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .

the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the operation is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) sites on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the medic@@ in@@ ally effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin humane ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be absorbed first , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ ate , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which passes through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the site of the inj@@ ections - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma ) may occur .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape @-@ sugar pieces , sweets , biscuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy Hypo@@ gly@@ kä@@ mien with unconscious will be treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non@@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent larger surgical procedures showed that a 42 % reduction in mortality ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) was reduced by 42 % .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of the operation is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or pla@@ ques ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still higher than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / d@@ l. in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a daily dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l. in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 subjects under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also pose a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including an illness known or present in medical history and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum urine acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and teenagers Sin@@ ce there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular Disease Pati@@ ents with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ sa@@ genic medicines , there may be an acute g@@ out attack during the treatment beginning because of the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ aric acid levels , ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can initially be mobili@@ zed .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine occurs in rare cases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ it treatment and in the course of the process ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ IL did not conduct reci@@ pro@@ cal studies for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous application of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ aci@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not be related to side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

the risk factors calculated in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could stand in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported overall more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diar@@ rhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin les@@ ions or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 Pati@@ ents up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups overall more than once and occurred in patients who received f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .

the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ aric acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ loc@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of the ser@@ um@@ aric acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. at the beginning of the study .
the data obtained in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum amounts to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out occur@@ ren@@ ces ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the pla@@ ques , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ litter k@@ not until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and were also received in patients who received al@@ loc@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased dos@@ is@@ proportional after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration levels provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the urine was found in the urine as an imm@@ utable f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair occurred as an unchanged f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .

these findings are seen as a result of specific specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have an effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in the case of high doses that were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a reduction in the intake capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in load @-@ bearing rats with ex@@ positions , approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where bones become brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include headaches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( intestinal disorders ) , intestinal ul@@ cer@@ ations ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic re@@ pul@@ sion .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the European Commission of Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed after rising the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not submit before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can be given under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a malign@@ ant irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , the stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market launch ) , including some severe and with complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the placement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a max@@ illary surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take one tablet per week as originally planned for the day of the week .
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates in patients ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosphor@@ ous up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ follow a oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at The therapeutic balance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was demonstrated in a single @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the Fra@@ k@@ tur intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction in the placebo group ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients receiving one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued , and the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit was made up of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily ( either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Be@@ aked to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability rose accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful modification of the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then quickly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at about 50 % of the radio@@ actively lab@@ elled substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the administration of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the case after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see Section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential do not reveal any particular dangers for humans .

advance is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of adv@@ enti@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ ts and 129 patients with liver transplantation have been carried out and examined how advance is taken by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , advance is not allowed .
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with advance , as the advance dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to alternative form@@ ulations , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of adv@@ an@@ f should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after moving from Pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ting under advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the advance dose can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ an@@ f therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further can adap@@ tations can be required later as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ an@@ f therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Transi@@ tion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t recipient from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of advance is changed , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
transplantation of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ant once a day must begin treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t With adult patients who are switched to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ an@@ uts in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal cancer patients , was applied in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with transplan@@ ted gra@@ ft receivers in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the target area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ at@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When changing from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the levels of blood in whole blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the help of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ k@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus total blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ kan@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may take several days until the steady state has entered state .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data available for the ardi@@ an@@ ary formulation advance .
the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft receivers in childhood does not yet prec@@ ede clinical data for the spar@@ se formulation advance .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood @-@ levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum defect described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under advance .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infection , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ an@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose , patients with the rare heredi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption treat special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while administ@@ ering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal degradation .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious to make decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially decrease the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of examinations for transplan@@ t patients do not provide a clu@@ e that at tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in case of uter@@ o exposure , supervision of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined because of the basic disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ ant .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and proliferation of the B cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ Interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients transplan@@ ted , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) , in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the cases were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were transferred from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi @-@ center study involving oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which were random@@ ised to receive tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplantation demonstrated an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infection , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ zumab , which lead to tal@@ low between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplantation ( Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ o@@ arthritis and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile .
systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) compared to an overall daily dose compared to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the overall daily dose .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data available for the ardi@@ an@@ ary formulation advance .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infection , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .

supplements are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are determined by whether adv@@ ate is used to treat hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A are suffering from a factor VI@@ II deficiency causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
supplements are similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the drug does not contain proteins of human@@ eness or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ sis with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
supplements should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for the placing of adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute depression are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ life times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of Factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to VI@@ II , the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ posi@@ tional days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ emergence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of whom were previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .

a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate again showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE to 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was identified at any of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated protein was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tre against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has evaluated the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considers that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s security profile , which makes it necessary to submit P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited has officially distributed the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the use of adv@@ enti@@ in for the treatment of lithium @-@ trafficking cancer .
normally , however , the breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures within the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus genetically engineered to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ o@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally helps restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , the bones and the brain .
after examining the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tumours brings benefits to the patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
furthermore , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that lawyers can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not know whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with lawyers .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nose by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ apped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze reported a decline in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with a@@ ero @-@ a@@ ze showed relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor in@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , from adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart and vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ic hyper@@ function ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n if necessary .
as Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ ges@@ tives ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ra@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data did not suff@@ ice to make appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment of a hyper@@ ton@@ ia or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening the headache ) must be stopped .
patients suffering from heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze must be stopped at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the context of clinical examinations with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with placebo and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not block in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of pregn@@ ancies revealed , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
the patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry conditions , pu@@ pill@@ ary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks related to flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not increase the frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the floating equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent had been used for exposure after application of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and repeti@@ tive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application , it is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to reli@@ eving the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous swelling of the drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine containing in this drug .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ si@@ fying ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach exit or the du@@ oden@@ um ( intestinal ob@@ struction ) , a bladder neck clasp , prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of a@@ ero : • high blood pressure • Cardi@@ ac disease • Cardi@@ ac disease • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headaches .
when taking Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
in case of application in recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take it as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes have been reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver damage has also been very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2,5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of asthma patients ) .
efficacy was measured by measuring the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ p@@ pling , disability of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way that the tablets and the application in children are harmless .
in the case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the number of symptoms ( symptom pun@@ cture ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease process and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed when they occur .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy season .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while consuming A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years of age , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ Sel@@ ine to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical trial ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , watering and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
since the history of hist@@ am@@ ines is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of the patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphy was comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance strain ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that of children who normally metaboli@@ se .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , consuming A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily amount of 1,@@ 25 mg daily ( ages 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not increase the frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in an individual dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents conducted clinical trials for no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol induced power impair@@ ment or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , watering and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation following daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were applied .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was tolerated well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets once daily , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be taken without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under the age of 6 have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the hem@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the wor@@ ding of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined on pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most commonly reported adverse events were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the adult population and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not increase the frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. received the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its motion for the introduction of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognizes the part of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in a contact with a flu virus .
the membrane she@@ ath of the virus was then removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a physical body ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking into account , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight .
in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
however , AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine am@@ used with low dos@@ ed ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase launched with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r extracts the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to those who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals which are degra@@ ded just like as@@ say and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take ast@@ er@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery of the immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ val@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have out@@ weighed the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ best@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was originally approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit to transport as@@ best@@ ase throughout the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
normally aspir@@ in capsules to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be administered together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ val@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day combined with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ val@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ best@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
normally , A@@ val@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al glands ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alized ratio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
for patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of obesity , especially when administered also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
am@@ per@@ ase should be set in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy was required to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , a higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term care of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines , whose agents are primarily metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for concur@@ rent administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended close monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of as@@ best@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in has been performed , however , due to the attached component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ best@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ night avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if these medicines are used together , caution must be advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ um is difficult .
the simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin lead to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ best@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole twice a day led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may , if applied together with as@@ best@@ ase , may cause interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if used in combination with as@@ best@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as am@@ ends since it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme products ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 10 , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and reinforce with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma level rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ best@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase plasma levels while passing A@@ generation .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with care at the same time .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors suggest a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of obesity , especially when administered also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation as to how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ best@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alized ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in the breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in the seed .
further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernity .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ best@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the as@@ best@@ ase @-@ treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the treatment of the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or other drugs used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects described below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 200 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as seen in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and peripheral fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ c fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ ch@@ opping ) .
among 113 patients who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a period of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients in in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pi@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , and occurred spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term care of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ val@@ ase twice daily along with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients receiving as@@ best@@ ase together with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is indicated for signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r allo@@ prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 2@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mutation V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 5@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ational patterns may be subject to changes caused by additional data , and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems are used to analyze the results of resistance tests .
clinical trials based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing schema failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a wide range of mut@@ ations that can be detri@@ mental to subsequent treatment .
the proof of efficacy of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study in which treated with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ best@@ ase , at least another PI , and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ cut threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase activity is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and capsules was evaluated three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ best@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ yiel@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ is should be considered in therapy optimisation in with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , but for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( c@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and the rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval ranges from c@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ best@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , aspir@@ in solution and as@@ best@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible and therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in case of dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dosing of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical application , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included reverse mut@@ ational tests ( am@@ it test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of an@@ gen@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed which indicate delayed development .
24 If as@@ best@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alized ratio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
am@@ per@@ ase should be de@@ composed in duration 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rophi@@ es was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for concur@@ rent administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended close monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution must be advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ um is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ best@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma level rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ best@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alized ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
concur@@ rent administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced body weight in po@@ sterity .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ best@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is indicated for signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are to be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ yiel@@ ding &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval ranges from c@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ best@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ational tests ( am@@ it test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabolism ways are not yet fully ripe , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ generic solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase solution was not occupied neither with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ val@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ best@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of as@@ best@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution is contra@@ indicated for children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ best@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alized ratio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
am@@ per@@ ase should be removed in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rophi@@ es was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and cause side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl@@ en@@ ly@@ co@@ l it may not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in the breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ best@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or other drugs used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r allo@@ prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a wide range of mut@@ ations that may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ yiel@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ is should be considered in therapy optimisation in with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ al volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ val@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to reinforce the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ best@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the above drugs .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to reinforce the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there is also no adequate information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy ampli@@ fication in children aged 4 to 12 or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • With small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • For ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , it can be applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week cycles of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately 8 hours ) on the skin before being washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but not the substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials in which the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The total recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ ode@@ pressed adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible inc@@ enses have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
interrup@@ tions in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if there is an infection in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were completely healed , another therapy should commen@@ ce ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned areas infected with skin until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , where no daily exercise was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a nar@@ c@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision were observed .
in the case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher doses than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which required treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency @-@ cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous remedies used to treat external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal areas has not yet been clinical experience .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream has shown less efficacy in this patient group concerning the removal of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions form after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumors .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lips of the lips .
very limited data about the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of the treatment or go back after the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower overall treatment rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be quanti@@ fied either after a unique or repeated top@@ ical application , no recommendation is given for use during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and likely or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % are among the most frequently reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream related side effects .
the 185 out of 185 bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects below .
the most common adverse effects , probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream related side effects , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events described by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the assessment of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weeks of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream , it often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ting / ab@@ sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the un@@ inten@@ tional , unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in accordance with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s topical application .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete ex@@ hal@@ ation of the genital war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is superior .
at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the ti@@ lt war@@ ts healed completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
total healing was achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ part application a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tumors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and remained dor@@ man@@ t for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical settlement after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , with 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application was low on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure appears to be very low .
tumours occurred in a group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream previously and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ di@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with recovery equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investigated the safety of the drug , but its efficacy was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and update this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms concerning the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. permission to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any adverse event occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that almost all patients will form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ cles ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ on with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to the mother &apos;s milk in relation to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , nas@@ al still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Re@@ perc@@ ussions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ formity was achieved within 3 months after the treatment was started , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up in patients at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with which there was never a server version .
patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction of G@@ AG &apos;s level in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions was typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the action of the enzyme is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ um and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of diseases , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg alb@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and mobility shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decline in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period , and the total pulmon@@ ary volum@@ ina increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study showed normal liver size .
within the first four weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG @-@ level in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes across the range of five action variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute range , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and an increase in weight ( n = 3 ) showed normal mental development ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form had a normal mental development rate whereas in older patients with severe forms of return no progress in cognitive development was to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ al meth@@ yl dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ level in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off dosing , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

the owner of the in@@ verter permit is to complete the following study program within the given time , the results of which are the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which sp@@ li@@ ts certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor if you are taking medications that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ ia me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
tips for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ IV @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils .
very common ( incidence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea , stomach pain • rash , joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ ten • fever lic@@ encing • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated .

preparation of the Al@@ bi@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ In@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , determine the number of di@@ lu@@ cent bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another cancer for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs for cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , decreased or the dose is decreased .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural endo@@ theli@@ oma A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in 7.@@ 9 months .
however , in both studies , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is taken from the through@@ flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² CO@@ F for in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is to be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ administration as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) per week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete bleeding pattern should be prepared before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit .
a dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle ; taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are based on the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( grade 3 or 4 ) occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or - at the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , an increased side effect risk was increased compared to patients at the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ inal value of &gt; 3,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) and &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored without immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed cannot be given to patients before their absolute neutral number again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count has again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous course cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ cre@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was moist@@ ened if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed are required to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients experiencing these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hypertension , or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion will be considered prior to the pel@@ let re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the concur@@ rent use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of reversible sc@@ aling of reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm .
high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed precip@@ itation resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advised when high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses are applied in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ odi@@ ous an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed cannot be used during pregnancy , unless it is absolutely mandatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table a 5 % threshold was set regarding the inclusion of all events in which the doctor advised a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 conden@@ sed phase 3 ( n = 16@@ 4 ) phase 2 , similar to the phase 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mono@@ therap@@ y@@ estu@@ dies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline scores of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC , random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ized to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , which was reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular tissue and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attack were occasionally reported in hospital studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
clinical studies occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ bacterial , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attacking points by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ synthesis ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ pl@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 trial of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month @-@ prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) versus the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival for patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el from 7.@@ 9 months ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival in the benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predomin@@ ant non @-@ hard drive epitheli@@ al type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.@@ 4 months , modified HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

dissolve the contents of 100 mg / ml bottles with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .

the resulting solution is clear and the stain@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take allergy and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot aboli@@ sh some fats in the diet , whereby about a quarter of the fats supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg observed an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared with 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus , gre@@ asy or o@@ ily chair , duct of o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant women or with breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with obesity ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only slightly resor@@ bed , the dosage is not necessary for elderly people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Bre@@ ast time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tics may need to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dose of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases of simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene have remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the plasma concentration of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of assimil@@ ated fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not app@@ rais@@ able ) .
the frequency of reported adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of un@@ defined magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings occurring .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ h@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect occurs in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ati@@ cal li@@ pas@@ ae .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , which blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ mic , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , changing body weight versus initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline : 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline value : 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any indication of cum@@ ulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ L leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , which accounted for approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

• Check fet@@ al to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical exercise . • Sta@@ y while taking and also after the intake of all@@ i physically active .
• all@@ i must not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot detect any reduction in your weight after 12 weeks of application , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • If weight is successful , it is not about changing the diet and returning to the old habits .
• If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .

severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe breathing difficulty , sweat drops , skin r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart ras@@ ps , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 of 10 people taking anywhere . • flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily ex@@ iting • P@@ ossi@@ bly or o@@ ily chair • Soft chair inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects intensi@@ fy or you significantly affect you .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that fat is increasingly ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks following the start of the treatment , as at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Start a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is decreasing .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not use any more medicine after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box . • Do not store above 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Sili@@ ca@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this one . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate causes of nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies leading to nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vomiting that is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on sage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al aut@@ op@@ sy or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised at the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ devi@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ state concentration of oral metast@@ asis , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ o@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not exist , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the site ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing testim@@ oni@@ als .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were carried out because of the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in the treatment of alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies using moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ o @-@ ization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption after intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decline of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total body composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ off intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one single dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted to two primary metaboli@@ tes , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism show C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ gly@@ cine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination following an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance was 53 ± 29 ml / min following a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection .
in patients with severe liver function disorders , the termin@@ ale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ o @-@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose matched roughly the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al bone mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the agency was recommended to use al@@ ph@@ one@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of the medic@@ aments provided for the treatment of hepatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is to resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage is detected , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the Al@@ ph@@ eon producer presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of reference medicinal product .
the study measured how many patients responded to 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to prohi@@ bit the approval of the placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns were expressed as to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was fl@@ amed back to more patients than with reference medication ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the drug identifies an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected wounds ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ther@@ ly filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections prov@@ oked or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the surface of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. permission to transport Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ina Sal@@ be , the treatment should be cancelled , the o@@ int@@ ment di@@ lig@@ ently wi@@ ped carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection commen@@ ces .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were obtained in humans after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , c@@ anned adap@@ tations are not required when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or termin@@ ated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that used al@@ tar@@ go , the most widely reported side effect was irritation at the site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
through binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partly block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some forms of infection appears to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ic o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and de@@ filed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ina Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of spar@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ Med@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retina in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid alterations .
in @-@ vitro test on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of bare skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 @-@ fold the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ ci@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of ambi@@ tions throughout the entire country .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her can be desired for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ viral surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same size as after ino@@ cul@@ ation with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured if immuno@@ competent persons , who responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a re@@ fres@@ her as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and surveillance should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system there may be no sufficient anti @-@ virus and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels , so that additional vaccine doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ le success , these injection path@@ ways should be avoided .
in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ er and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a basis of calculation for a vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation for each person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received meth@@ anol reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been ino@@ cul@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness per pro@@ band was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year olds , however , after ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ course vaccine with meth@@ anol or during the 3 @-@ course vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed , the level of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix after 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ines .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both trials , the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with meth@@ anol or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine regi@@ men with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was demonstrated at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ virus and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the re@@ fres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by waste water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before both vacc@@ ines have doubled ( although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if your child has severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with ambition .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ mines .
ambi@@ valence can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicines / take it ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated or has received / or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / or this is planned in the near future .
however , in this case , the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ valence , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case of 10 vacc@@ inated cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ tern@@ ity • irrit@@ ability • headaches • loss of appetite
blood pressure ( up to 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) , are :
these include locally limited or extended envel@@ opes which can be it@@ ching or ves@@ icle @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye contours and the face , resp@@ ectable breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .
flu @-@ like discomfort , including shi@@ vers , muscle and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ conception such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant walking , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you / your child substantially or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this pack template .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since the first approval for the marketing of the market , the CH@@ MP under@@ took the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ tions remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral damage following high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed into food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ ise stroke ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) resp@@ . one nose @-@ probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medication , i.e. without an active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , pal@@ pit@@ ations , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that high ammon@@ ia levels were effectively prevented in patients with ur@@ ination of the ure@@ a cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information on this medicine was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ote : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it became a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk by humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated in the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials involving AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an unlikely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which has shown a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metaboli@@ se active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is comparable to est@@ rogen ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for every gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival and clinical results .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated permanently with sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , showed 98 % overall survival .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enriched in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine being produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ te and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in the case of so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
following an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ stic disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ am@@ ate had no lam@@ ented effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ po@@ id or nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ote : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat bits were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
an unlikely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is comparable to est@@ rogen ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with ur@@ ination cycle disorders , it can be assumed that sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen for each gram .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ nit@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ propylene but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , decreased hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use@@ able until &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exp@@ ir@@ ation date . &quot; &quot; &quot;

when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or over a stomach fi@@ st@@ bin ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that runs through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife push over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
angi@@ ography is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment in which the effect of angi@@ ogen@@ esis was compared to a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , patients also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as deriv@@ atives and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI &apos;s gift - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year altogether as effectively as the conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ography must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other har@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it is also not allowed to be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd which was approved for the launch of Angi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ogen@@ esis in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in the next episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure a stud of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ogen@@ esis in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one directly following IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ in @-@ one angi@@ ogen@@ esis was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before application and the use of the bolt can be administered rapidly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ography is contra@@ indicated .
treatment with Angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against har@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible ble@@ mis@@ hes . • heavy un@@ controlled hypertension ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of bleeding at arter@@ ial points occur in patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can , in principle , experience ble@@ ed@@ ings throughout the treatment .
in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din again reaches the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be monitored regularly .
the animal experimental investigations are inadequate regarding the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ or@@ dru@@ id plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY difficult hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occurring in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system groups in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ography contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ge inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the anim@@ ator region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ ine on its part slowly split the bonds of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with serum from patients with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ assisted Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past had no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tic ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently carried out following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion could be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to either obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or by PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angi@@ ogen@@ es in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing per@@ kut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as a pe@@ p@@ tide passes a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metaboli@@ te resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ b@@ sin differs very slightly from insulin analog , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working life than a short acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot effectively metaboli@@ se insulin .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was noted in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin sensitivity .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,@@ 30 % with human insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insul@@ ing@@ lu@@ b@@ sin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients can be reduced with a restriction of the liver function .
any changes in the effectiveness of the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in the insulin requirement .
3 inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ sensitive diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the change of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment is changed .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ine , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , the effect of symp@@ athetic polym@@ ers such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ ci@@ sin and insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin sensitivity occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral hygiene .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a su@@ itably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after an injection of glucose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin and the active time is shorter than in the normal insulin analog .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ - tus , insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg revealed a dose @-@ proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an inferior glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ b@@ sin has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than insulin analog .
from the data it was obvious that a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ b@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human@@ oid insulin analog , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
