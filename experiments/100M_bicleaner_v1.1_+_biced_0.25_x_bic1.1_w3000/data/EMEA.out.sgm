<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. cervical thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to initiate or use the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole probably works primarily as a" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize brain activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and resorption of resorption (intake).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reduced in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled strain), tremor (permanent urge), tremor (sleepiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefit of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. permission to transport Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes attached to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no higher risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertonic disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify show signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and addressing for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipic, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is to be expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extender metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as istraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">Following the release of the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose prior to start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextrometamorphous).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treating with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and the concerns raised in the reproductive-studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole showed a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parsonism, acathema, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with arpiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olancinolus therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another 12 weeks study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phosphor kinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2,0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute dosages with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks for healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients receiving a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">Placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazole, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantain controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a significant reduction of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosages over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed superiority compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole did not show superiority compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a preserving effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, compared to placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylic acid of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extender metabolites via CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific study on pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the detriment of the liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulfate metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, concentrations of the sulfate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of ape, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Bilify injection solution is used for rapid control of agility and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazole injection solution and begin with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the drug characteristics to Abilify tablets, Abilify melted tablets or Abilify solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution is deemed necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescriptive or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertonic disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipic, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally associated with schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the single dose of Aripiprazole, in a study in which a healthy test subjects Aripiprazole (15mg dose) were administered intramuscular and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' metabolites can result in common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">Following the release of the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose prior to start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole's sole gift.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another 12 weeks study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2,0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline value on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed with respect to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients receiving a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression-rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">Placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazole (orally), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olantain controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, an increase of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study program in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, the study showed a superior response to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first two hours of intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% higher than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which was intra-muscular in 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, no safety concerns were found after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulfate metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, three quarters of which had received an anthracycline earlier.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in only some administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">A total of 72 (31%) of the 229 treated patients responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who are breastfeeding or low in the blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) stated that, in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel, it was more effective than conventional paclitaxel to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (Neutrophilately &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy type 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="279">No studies have been conducted with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose changes in patients with kidney function impairment (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bonded nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have significantly other pharmacological features than other formulations of Paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="283">In patients no further treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils is increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardio-toxicity has not been proven, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If, after the treatment of Abraxane, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea occur in patients, they may be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age, who do not have effective contraception, except the treatment of mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conserving, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect transport efficiency and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects, which were performed in combination with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>

<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate dehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood cardiac diseases:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, soreness in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, muscle pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrobial agent which promotes the pooling of microtubules from the tubular indimaries and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenithelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 albumreceptor and, due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-arm unconnected studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour fusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes fusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of the patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the treatment of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel according to 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active agents (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous application of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2, the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular spread and / or soft tissue integration of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared with the IV-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent-containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the abrasion-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in people with metastatic breast carcinoma the mean value of the untreated total dose was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, like other potentially toxic substances, should be handled with caution when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="361">The treatment with the streseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make their own blood donation, the streamed streamed has to be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be controlled before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Absinamed was compared to the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients had been injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they either received either streamed streamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erkro.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin levels between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between the weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of streseamed injected under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erkro in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were amed to the retina were maintained to the same degree as those receiving Eprex / Erkro.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erkro showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Streseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The CHMP Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that in accordance with the European Union regulations, it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erkro.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction in transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], in case of blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood volume (4 or more units blood in men; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaemia and follicas may vary depending on age, sex, and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients occasionally individual hemoglobin levels can be observed via or under the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin ability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and subsequent manifestations may vary depending on age, sex, and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin ability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reciprocal cyte count by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reciprolocyte count &lt; 40,000 cells / µl are increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reciprolocyte count by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl is increased three times a week, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resp. the reciprolocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an appeal to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), which require the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood congestions, should receive a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible, for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation programme, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">On this occasion, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from arthroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive the streamed streamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoma (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effectiveness, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin levels (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the rectiulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the timbocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Retiulocyte "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone marrow should be considered to diagnose PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Absinamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epoetins, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for control of the anaemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa is not accelerated in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, and the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and the erythropoetin response should be considered (patients who may have to be transcoded) for evaluating the effectiveness of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the goal of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly if possible before epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epoetin alfa, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can exist for patients with an initial residual current of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular occurrences such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), transitory ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, aneurymal thrombosis, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations for thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically acquired epoetin alfa is glycosilized and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydrate portion, identical with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with haemoblasts (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 24 other hemoblasts) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 Mamma carcinomas, 22 prostate carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 more).</seg>
<seg id="437">In 1895, patients with solid tumours (683 breast carcinomas, 260 bronchial carcinomas, 174 gynaecological tumors, 300 gastrointestinal tumors and 478 other) and 802 patients with hemoblasts.</seg>
<seg id="438">Survival and progression progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo controlled studies and progression-free progression.</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, anaemia treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed an anaemia consistent, statistically significantly higher mortality compared to controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and associated complications in recombinant human erythropoetin and in controls satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa regulations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours for healthy volunteers and an extended half-life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no cumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hemodialysis patients treated with epoetin alfa three years ago, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="449">14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose applied to men, epoetin alfa led to reduced fötalem body weight, a delay of the oscification and an increase in fetal mortality.</seg>

<seg id="543">A 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood levels (hemoglobin) and adjust your flamed dose appropriately to minimize the risk of thrombosis (thrombotic event).</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed down very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (adipous) or if in the past thrombotic vascular events occurred (e.g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">In case you are cancer patient, keep in mind that streseamed acts as a growth factor for blood cells, and under certain circumstances can have a negative effect on the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you have a larger orthopedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of red blood pigment (haemoglobin) are too high you should not receive the flamed streamed because there is an increased risk of blood clots after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well adjusted, you receive regular dosages between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, distributed on two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to check the success rate and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">In order to ensure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the attending physician will perform regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before the surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery, on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor considers this appropriate, you can also learn how to splash the streseamed himself beneath the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhages, strokes, temporary circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, vascular thrombosis, vascular thrombosis, vascular thrombosis, retinal vasculature, and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from erythropoietin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eye lids and lips (Quincke edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastoma means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Particular Care in the Application of Abseamed is required").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations, regardless of the treatment with the streamed streamed, it can cause blood clots (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with streseamed can be associated with increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-post thrombotic vascular events) if your output level is too high</seg>
<seg id="565">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or if you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>

<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Paget disease, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>

<seg id="575">Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients at Morbus Paget and compared with Risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or decreased at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients with Aclasta (without other osteoporosis drugs) has been reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Comparing all patients with Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis drugs) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients with Aclasta had a fracture (92 out of 1 065) versus 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, Aclasta's patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta's manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the placing of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="587">The Patient Information package is to be provided and include the following key messages: • Suppression in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="589">For postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic acetylation the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget disease, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fractures, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by adding acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function impairment (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended, as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) are not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data for safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledronylic acid on bone structure, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be examined before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental interventions, no data is available, whether the disruption of bisphosphonates treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after receiving Aclasta may be reduced by application of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">A very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serine creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the incidence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the placebo and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinin within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta in comparison to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patients treated with Aclasta in the patients with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to prevent clinical fractures following hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures following a recently fractured hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of oledronylic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion site such as reddening, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been studious, especially for cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonates, including zoledronylic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta sensed significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta patients aged 75 and older had a 60% lower risk of spine fractures compared to placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at lumbar influoric acid, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increasing the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the neck lower by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteoporotic patients who were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were collected one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin comb.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with Aclasta in comparison to placebo, an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to baseline value and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortalities were 10% (101 patients) in the Aclasta group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased the BMD at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">For more than 24 months, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo, and 4.3% on the thighs.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% for Aclasta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308) the annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior compared to the one-week administration of Alendronat relative to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderate morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase corresponding to 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months has been proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain effects was observed after 6 months compared to the starting value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">The 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study could maintain the therapeutic response of 141 of the patients treated with Risedronate in a mean follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronylic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the pulmonary cycle with half-life hours t ½ β 0,24 and t ½ β-1.87 hours, followed by a prolonged elimination phase with a terminale exclusion period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ values) probably represent rapid resorption in bone and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to a 30% reduction in zinc concentration at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration vs. time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzymes is unlikely, because it is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledronic acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disturbance down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the tolled acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is limited, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-recurring intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC were 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledronylic acid was determined in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiseptic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, a teratogeneity of dosages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the low serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronylic acid is a substance class representative called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are formed from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget morbus, bone breakdown takes place too quickly, and new bone material is formed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by restoring the bone structure to normal, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and reinforces the strength of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are using drugs known to harm the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), metformin alone cannot be satisfactorily adjusted in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl diurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonic resn or insulin can be maintained with start of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonic resins or the insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making Type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos reduced the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the plebistherapy study, the effects of Actos added to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfa resin in a reduction in HbA1c levels by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive to pioglitazon or any of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit to transport Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available to use Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. a heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">Pioglitazon may not be used in patients with high-output hepatic cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes must be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme parameters must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be conducted by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been identified, which can stem from fatty deposits and, in some cases, is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin levels (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials of Pioglitazon in patients with metformin (relative reduction in haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two or three-fold combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, we reported a decrease in visual acuity under treatment with thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, an incidence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture response was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison meditate.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interaction of drugs have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazon reduces the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimable from available data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and the refractive index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range were comparable to placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups with metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure in Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon or Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, Pioglitazon has rarely been reported about heart failure, but more commonly when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients was conducted in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison meditate.</seg>
<seg id="797">If the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, followed by 180 mg / day for seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucosal production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect was evaluated (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the therapy started, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was not adequately adjusted in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin were randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under Pioglitazon reduced the mean hbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials for one year, a statistically significant decline in the albumin / creatinin ratio was statistically significant in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was studied in a small, 18-week study on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazon reduced overall plasma matrix glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol in Pioglitazon, whereas reduced values were observed under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglyceride level, but also improved the postdendial increased triglyceride level, both about the effect of triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups receiving either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination rate of unaltered pioglitazon is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazon reduces the hyperinsulin resistance resulting from the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindis resulted in an increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture response was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison meditate.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid respectively.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials for more than 1 year, a statistically significant decline in the albumin / creatinin ratio was statistically significant in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglyceride level, but also improved the postdendial increased triglyceride level, both about the effect of Tryglyceride concentrations and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortalities, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularisation and leg arisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular risk risks are associated with taking Pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actrophane in patients, it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which passes through several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in an uncontrolled diabettic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fructose in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasionally - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neuropathy and are normally reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 Intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar level can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin diseases and subcutaneous tissue joint - Lipodystrophies An injection site may develop a lipodystrophy if failed to change the institutations within the injection range.</seg>
<seg id="884">General diseases and complaints at the site of administration - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection point) may occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Guidance - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylagic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic edema, breathing difficulties, heartbeat, low blood pressure and impotence / loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape-sugar pieces, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy Hypoglykämien with unconscious will be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the operation is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fission (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproduction toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane flow bottle is taken from the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before being resusppled in accordance with the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and Vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than those receiving alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (intestinal disorders), intestinal ulcerations (bloated stomach) and acidic repulsion.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed after rising the day with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • Patients should not chew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not submit before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except pyloroplastic, can be given under special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strips, were reported in patients taking alendronat (partially these severe and required a hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the medicine in case of symptoms of malignant irritation like dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a malignant irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was detected, the stomach and duodenal ulcera were rare (after market launch), including some severe and with complications (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteoelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regimen predominantly contain intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the placement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients needing a maxillary surgical procedure decreases the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>

<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the middle ascents of BMD with alendronat 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the vertebral column, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% on the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction in the placebo group (alendronat 3.2% versus placebo 6,2%) was achieved in the percentage of patients receiving one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of spine and trochanter continued, and the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit was made up of two placebo-controlled studies where alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily (either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily administration of alendronat reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Beaked to an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability rose accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, Alendronat was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically meaningful modification of the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but is then quickly redistributed into the bone or excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronat about 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the threads.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance was not 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Excretion In the administration of radioactively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers, the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in the case after 4 days 4,9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is quickly excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced kidney function, an increased cumulation of alendronate in bone is expected (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close-meshed control of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to alternative formulations, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advanf should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After moving from Prograf to advance, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus-Talking levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplanting under advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adaptation of the advance dose can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - Kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advanf therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further can adaptations can be required later as pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advanf therapy should begin at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Transition from Prograf to Advanf Must a transplant recipient from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of advance is changed, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Transplantation of other immunosuppressants to advant once a day must begin treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant With adult patients who are switched to advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advanuts in lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients, was applied in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with transplanted graft receivers in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the target area, a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not influence the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatininance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When changing from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the levels of blood in whole blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case with the help of full blood tacrolimus talkmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of the tacrolimus-level mirror during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after adjustment from Prograf to advance, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time use of substances that could change the tacrolimus total blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advkanf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may take several days until the steady state has entered state.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close-meshed control of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data available for the ardianary formulation advance.</seg>
<seg id="1442">The prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft receivers in childhood does not yet precede clinical data for the sparse formulation advance.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus-blood-levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a chamber or septum defect described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under advance.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infection, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advanf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, patients with the rare hereditary lactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption treat special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while administering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal degradation.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposure, it is particularly cautious to make decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of examinations for transplant patients do not provide a clue that at tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In case of utero exposure, supervision of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patients transplanted, with 475 patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after a intestinal transplant as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multicenter study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, bronchiolitis obliteration syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimuscle and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Compared to 38.0% in Ciclosporin (p = 0.025), in 21,7% of cases treated with tacrolimus, the cases were compared to 38.0%.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were transferred from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-center study involving oral prograf was conducted on 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which were randomised to receive tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a moncentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation demonstrated an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infection, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolizumab, which lead to tallow between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplantation (Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematoarthritis and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion takes place mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower compared to Prograf in stable patients (once daily) compared to an overall daily dose compared to 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the overall daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform common controls of the tacrolimus-level mirror during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data available for the ardianary formulation advance.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Supplements are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (caused by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are determined by whether advate is used to treat hemorrhages or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A are suffering from a factor VIII deficiency causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Supplements are similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the drug does not contain proteins of humaneness or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepsis with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Supplements should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a licence for the placing of advate in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the magnitude of exposure to VIII, the risk within the first 20 Expositional days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant VIII product to another, the reemergence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has evaluated the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considers that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which makes it necessary to submit PSURs every 6 months, to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the use of adventiin for the treatment of lithium-trafficking cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures within the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus genetically engineered to carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advoin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally helps restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, where Li-Fraumeni-Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdomen, the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After examining the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-tumours brings benefits to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Furthermore, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that lawyers can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not know whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed drug release" means that the tablets are composed in a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nose by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clapped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients receiving Aeronaze reported a decline in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with aero-aze showed relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor inactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, from adrenergic agents or loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must not be used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart and vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroic hyperfunction), or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking them, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as monotherapy with desloratadin if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aeronaze contains pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of termination of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other Dekongestives (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napraolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective, and the data did not suffice to make appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerobaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment of a hypertonia or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening the headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients suffering from heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerobaze must be stopped at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, as antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical examinations with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with placebo and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not block in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of pregnancies revealed, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to impairment of the transport tightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, pre-cordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry conditions, pupillary starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance, including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily did not increase the frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerobaze tablets was significantly higher than under one monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the floating equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent had been used for exposure after application of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity and repetitive toxicity, genotoxicity and reproduction toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the Pharmacovigilance system described in the Authorisation Application, it is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to relieving the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of aero: • high blood pressure • Cardiac disease • Cardiac disease • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aeronaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">In case of application in recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take it as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver damage has also been very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2,5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of asthma patients).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by measuring the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrippling, disability of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way that the tablets and the application in children are harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In the case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in the number of symptoms (symptom puncture) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials at Urticaria, the decline in the scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease process and may be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed when they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy season.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while consuming Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the transport tightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported daily in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years of age, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Seline to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical trial) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, watering and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamines is a causative factor in all of the urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin also leads to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistaminika was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demography was comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproduction toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience a higher substance strain (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metabolized is identical to that of children who normally metabolise.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose insufficiency should not use this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, consuming Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11, who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy, received a daily amount of 1,25 mg daily (ages 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study in adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day for adults and adolescents did not increase the frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In an individual dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents conducted clinical trials for no impairment of psychomotor functions.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol induced power impairment or an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, watering and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this constrained phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger with blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The strain (AUC) caused by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation following daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the AUC and CMAx values of Desloratadin in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. received the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdrew its motion for the introduction of Aflunov on the prevention of aviaries H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus, which might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognizes the part of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">The membrane sheath of the virus was then removed with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a physical body), cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "Good Clinical Practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for taking into account, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked what antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other anti-viral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS is not able to cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine amused with low dosed rionavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase launched with ritonavir extracts the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, along with Ritonavir, came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to those who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenera must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals which are degraded just like assay and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asterase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery of the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Avalase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years have outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of asbestase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors was not proven.</seg>

<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit to transport asbestase throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Normally aspirin capsules to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir should be administered together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Ambuavir as capsule; therefore, Avalase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice a day combined with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Avalase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asbestase, does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Normally, Avalase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal glands (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an concurrent administration of Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International normalized ratio), methods for determining the substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of obesity, especially when administered also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amperase should be set in duration 5, if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy was required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug addictive factors such as a longer-lasting anti-retroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hammophilous patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors there are reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haematothrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, a higher body mass index), cases of osteonecarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term care of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width agenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width agenerase with ritonavir must not be combined with medicines, whose agents are primarily metabolized via CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir causing a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for concurrent administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended close monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study for the use of asbestase in combination with didanosin has been performed, however, due to the attached component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and asbestase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and knight avir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution must be advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirum is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous injection of amprenavir and rifabutin lead to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asbestase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole twice a day led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69fold compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may, if applied together with asbestase, may cause interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if used in combination with asbestase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as amends since it can lead to resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as enzyme products (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradicpin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir 10, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous consumption of Agenerase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors related side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma level rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of asbestase with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase plasma levels while passing Ageneration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time by amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using parenteral Midazolam with care at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of obesity, especially when administered also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation as to how to adjust the amprenavirus dosage if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asbestase, increased control of the INR (International normalized ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amprenavir survives in the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">During the lactation period, a reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given to amprenavir in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight in the seed.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the maternity.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asbestase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the asbestase-treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the treatment of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking Agenera or other drugs used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects described below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors did not receive 200 mg Agenera twice daily with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as seen in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and peripheral fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsoc fat accumulation (Stiernchopping).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 patients who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a period of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients in indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopious nature, with or without itching, and occurred spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term care of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg Avalase twice daily along with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients receiving asbestase together with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is indicated for signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures are to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-Pol- polypropylene precursors resulting from an formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Ambuavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir alloproteinase inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, Q58E, D60E, I2V, A71V, V77V, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and their prolongation APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutation V32I + 147a / V, I52V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir and reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutational patterns may be subject to changes caused by additional data, and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems are used to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinical trials based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (separators) for FPV / RTV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, but sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not pretreated patients in which a Fosamprenavirus-containing schema failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), ininavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 Isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa Ambuavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a wide range of mutations that can be detrimental to subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of efficacy of agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study in which treated with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (virusload ≥ 1000 copies / ml) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asbestase, at least another PI, and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-undercut threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The efficacy of unbundled asterase activity is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children between the ages of 2 and 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera solution for intake and capsules was evaluated three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed rionavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with asbestase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unyielding" "" "ageneris should be considered in therapy optimisation in with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, but for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (cmin, ss) was impacted by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval ranges from cMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may be administered with caution when given at the same time with asbestase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, aspirin solution and asbestase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible and therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in case of dosages that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dosing of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the actual exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutical application, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included reverse mutational tests (amit test), mouse-lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far no significant liver toxicity has been observed in clinical trials, neither during administration of angenase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly lower (rats) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed which indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asbestase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight hepatic dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International normalized ratio), methods for determining the substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Amperase should be decomposed in duration 27, if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophies was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting anti-retroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir causing a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for concurrent administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended close monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution must be advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirum is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asbestase, at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradicpin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma level rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asbestase, increased control of the INR (International normalized ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Concurrent administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg of norethindron) led to an acceptance of the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Ambuavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa Ambuavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unyielding" asterase should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval ranges from cMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may be administered with caution when given at the same time with asbestase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible; therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in dosages that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and likely or possibly associated with the application of imiquimide cream in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1% are among the most frequently reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of imiquimide cream related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The 185 out of 185 basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse effects, probably or possibly with the application of the imiquimide cream related side effects, were a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events described by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The assessment of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three weeks of treatment with imiquimide cream, it often came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreting / abscaling (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream is very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and heavy scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis Alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The unintentional, unique oral intake of 200 mg imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected in accordance with Imiquimod's topical application.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete exhalation of the genital warts during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod, the tilt warts healed completely; this was in 20% of the 105 patients with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Total healing was achieved at 23% of 157 treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy in five-part application a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficially artificial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and remained dormant for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Imiquimod's efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observational studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical settlement after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external genital warts, actinic keratosis and artificial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours, with 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod to topical application was low on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6-12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficient basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure appears to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumours occurred in a group of mice treated with the substance-free cream previously and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficiality basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When it remains untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore, early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to solar radiation during their previous lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in flat aktinic keratosis on the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>

<seg id="2253">If other medicines have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream is after sexual intercourse (not before) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have used other medicines or recently applied, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different from tilt warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific directions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the tilt warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with tilt skin under the foreskin need to pull back the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before using Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks, apply a sufficient amount of aldara cream every 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist about it immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the Aldara cream application.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause a blue stain to develop faster or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which sound again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Some patients occasionally notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (blood, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, blistering or bruising), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal congestion, swelling of the eyelids, throat, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Alsatiazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldiazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with recovery equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigated the safety of the drug, but its efficacy was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by around 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alsatiazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving aldurazyms concerning the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. permission to transport Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Alsatiazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Alsatiazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Alsatiazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any adverse event occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, it is expected that almost all patients will form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously preceded by the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with drugs (antihistaminika and / or antipyreticles) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Fusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interferon with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to the mother's milk in relation to laronidase, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Alsatiazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Alsatiazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequencies: ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, nasal stills and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Repercussions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a predominantly severe form of expiration and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 mg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconformity was achieved within 3 months after the treatment was started, with a more severe form of follow-up in patients at the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early excretion from the study), no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with which there was never a server version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction of GAG's level in urine while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions was typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the action of the enzyme is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrum and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire spectrum of diseases, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg albdurazyms each week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and mobility shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline in the expected percentage of FEV is not clinically significant over this period, and the total pulmonary volumina increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly prior to treatment 22 (85%) up to the end of the study showed normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first four weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG-level in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was found, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes across the range of five action variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute range, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetic of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- Mirror in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and an increase in weight (n = 3) showed normal mental development (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form had a normal mental development rate whereas in older patients with severe forms of return no progress in cognitive development was to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldural methyl dosage schemes were carried out on the GAG-level in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 mg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural endothelioma Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another cancer for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the single administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to docetaxel in 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is taken from the throughflow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² COF for infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid is to be given the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed-administration as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) per week before the first pemetrexed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a complete bleeding pattern should be prepared before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle; taking into account the Nadirs of the blood-image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are based on the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled, if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity (grade 3 or 4) occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or - at the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over, an increased side effect risk was increased compared to patients at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminal value of &gt; 3,0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) and &gt; 5,0-times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored without immunosuppression and Pemetrexed cannot be given to patients before their absolute neutral number again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte count has again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous course cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-crematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was moistened if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed are required to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measures to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsaliva (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients experiencing these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, preexisting hypertension, or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion will be considered prior to the pellet remixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with pemetrexed, if this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the concurrent use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of reversible scaling of reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetremixed precipitation resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advised when high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses are applied in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with anodious antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed cannot be used during pregnancy, unless it is absolutely mandatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of reversible damage to reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antibacterial, which exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies, Pemetrexed works as an anti-folate with multiple attacking points by blocking thymidylatsynthesis (TS), Dihydroplatreductase (DHFR) and glycine amidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), the key enzymes of de novo biosynthesis by thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, simple-blind phase 3 trial of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit of a median 2.8-month-prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2501">Solve the contents of 500 mg / ml bottles with 20 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the staining ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish without compromising the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low-calorie, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who take allergy and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot abolish some fats in the diet, whereby about a quarter of the fats supplied with food undigested the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg observed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared with 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on the anus, flatus, greasy or oily chair, duct of oily secretions (fences), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients who suffer from long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease) suffer, and in pregnant women or with breast-feeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of Orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with obesity (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only slightly resorbed, the dosage is not necessary for elderly people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Breast time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or high-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetics may need to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dose of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of Ciclosporin plasma was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases of simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normal-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who have been treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene have remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone, a small number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the plasma concentration of Amiodarone.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of assimilated fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not appraisable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is not known as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of undefined magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipashinhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect occurs in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of the gastrian and pankreatical lipasae.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg orlistat is taken three times a day, which blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalmic, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, changing body weight versus initial value (at the time of randomisation) was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg -2.4% (baseline: 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline value: 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any indication of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after separation of the N-FormyL leucine group), were identified, which accounted for approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproduction toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Pharmacovigilance system The holder of authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmacovigilance system, according to the version of July 2007, is described, applied and works before and while the product is available on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that fat is increasingly excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks following the start of the treatment, as at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: • Start a few days, or better a week, before the first intake of capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies that are moderate causes of nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-emetic agent).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies leading to nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the placing of Aloxi across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting that is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon sage, patients with anamnestial autopsy or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised at the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclodeviamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state concentration of oral metastasis, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinoine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not exist, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events (a total of 633 patients) were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be associated with Aloxi headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the site (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis trials were carried out because of the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective in the treatment of aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies using moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of preclinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repo-ization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG effects of palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption after intravenous administration follows an initial decline of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total body composition (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-off intravenous dose of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one single dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted to two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism show CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isoglycine CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination following an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance was 53 ± 29 ml / min following a one-time intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures which are considered sufficient above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can only block Ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repo-arization and can prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose matched roughly the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal bone marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because aloxi is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the agency was recommended to use alphone6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of the medicaments provided for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is to resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage is detected, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheon producer presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CHMP to prohibit the approval of the placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed as to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was flamed back to more patients than with reference medication; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the drug identifies an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected wounds (cracking or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been provably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds, about 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eitherly filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections provoked or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. permission to transport Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitizing or severe local irritation due to the use of Retapamina Salbe, the treatment should be cancelled, the ointment diligently wiped carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection commences.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were obtained in humans after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamic ointment increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, canned adaptations are not required when topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamic ointment should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued or terminated or the therapy with altargo should be continued, is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that used altargo, the most widely reported side effect was irritation at the site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partly block P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at at least some forms of infection appears to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamin- versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamic ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and defiled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamina Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of spared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the RetapamMedulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of the in vitro oxidative metabolism of retina in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid alterations.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro test on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo-examination chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats of limited fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of bare skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-fold the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the marketing application, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the Marketing Institute is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in the 1.8.2 module of the authorisation application, as well as any additional updates of the RMP agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if you have not expressly been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is made of sewn on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if any discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gauze tape unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan can be completed from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the body's natural defences)," "" "as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults and the approved vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix conducted one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of ambitions throughout the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher can be desired for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-viral surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are in the same size as after inoculation with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured if immunocompetent persons, who responded to hepatitis A vaccination, need a refresher as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in the case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and surveillance should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system there may be no sufficient anti-virus and anti-HBs antibody levels, so that additional vaccine doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal imple success, these injection pathways should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous as an exception, since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered at the same time in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thiomer and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15, Ambirix was compared to the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a basis of calculation for a vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation for each person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received methanol reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been inoculated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matchiness per proband was comparable to 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year olds, however, after inoculation with Ambirix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-course vaccine with methanol or during the 3-course vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, the Sero-conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Sero-conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was prioritized, the level of seroprotection (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher than with Ambirix after 3-dose vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both trials, the vaccine received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with methanol or a 3-dose vaccine regimen with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was demonstrated at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month-vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatite A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-virus and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months-vaccination scheme to that in the 0-12-month-vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given at the same time with the refresher of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and Seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus, even if the full inoculation series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus before both vaccines have doubled (although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if your child has severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e., within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from an inoculation with ambition.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected by people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your / her body's own defense / or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis / undermines.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambivalence can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicines / take it (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated or has received / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have received / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, in this case, the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambivalence, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not given pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case of 10 vaccinated cans): • Pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Matternity • irritability • headaches • loss of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">Blood pressure (up to 1 case per 10 inoculated cans): • swelling at the injection site • fever (above 38 ° C) • drowsiness • gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 inoculated doses), are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extended envelopes which can be itching or vesicle-shaped, swelling of the eye contours and the face, respectable breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like discomfort, including shivers, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, misconception such as tingling and "ant walking," multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting inflammation of some blood vessels malaise or feeling of illness, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and abdominal pain Various liver function tests lymphatic gangliosis, increased inclination to bleeding or bruising (bruises) caused by falling of the blood platelet.</seg>
<seg id="2803">23 Informing your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you / your child substantially or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this pack template.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has become known since the first approval for the marketing of the market, the CHMP undertook the view that the benefit-risk ratio for ambitions remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (cerebral damage following high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed into food or administered via a gastropoise stroke (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) resp. one nose-probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medication, i.e. without an active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that high ammonia levels were effectively prevented in patients with urination of the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information on this medicine was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use when hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium bicylbutyote: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate or ornithine inscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the emergence of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium polyphenylbutyrate takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it became a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in breast milk by humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated in the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials involving AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An unlikely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which has shown a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolise active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetyl glutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetyl glutamine is comparable to estrogen (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium polyphenylbutyrate is produced for every gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetyl glutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of excretion of nitrogen (sodium polyphenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetate), reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first month of life) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the orniethinscarcanylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonic encephalopathy and were subsequently treated permanently with sodium bicylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, showed 98% overall survival.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enriched in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine being produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyte and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate in the case of sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium bicylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Following an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cystic disorders or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium bicylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated phenylacetyl glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium polyphenylbutyamate had no lamented effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastropoid or nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium bicylbutyote: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate or ornithine inscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat bits were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An unlikely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetyl glutamine is comparable to estrogen (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on tests on the excretion of phenylacetyl glutamine in patients with urination cycle disorders, it can be assumed that sodium polyphenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetyl glutamine-nitrogen for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutynitrate in granulatform 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium polypropylene butyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium bicylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium polyphenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other drugs or have recently taken drugs, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, decreased hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on the same single doses or over a stomach fistbin (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose that runs through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped measuring spoon of granulate from the container. • Place a straight edge, e.g. a knife push over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove surplus granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiography is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an abnormal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on ACS treatment in which the effect of angiogenesis was compared to a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), patients also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as derivatives and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without GPI's gift - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or one year altogether as effectively as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiography must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other harudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It is also not allowed to be used in patients who recently had hemorrhage, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The CHMP Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to The Medicines Company UK Ltd which was approved for the launch of Angiox in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose of angiogenesis in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in the next episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a stud of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiogenesis in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one directly following IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an all-in-one angiogenesis was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before application and the use of the bolt can be administered rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiography is contraindicated.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous administration of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against harudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible blemishes. • heavy uncontrolled hypertension (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of bleeding at arterial points occur in patients with bivalirudin, patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can, in principle, experience bleedings throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are using warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR-value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bivalirudin again reaches the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocyte aggregator), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregator inhibitors or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental investigations are inadequate regarding the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and biordruid plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY difficult hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, which required a radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages occurring in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system groups in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiography contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinge inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as in the animator region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thrombine on its part slowly split the bonds of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum from patients with thrombocytopenia / heparinassisted Thrombose Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past had no thrombocytic aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is substantiated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was subsequently carried out following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion could be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to either obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or by PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY difficult bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intra-cranial, retroperito-neural, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the area of the point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angiogenes in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing perkutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as a peptide passes a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminale sequence by thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lubsin differs very slightly from insulin analog, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working life than a short acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults in type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot effectively metabolise insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was noted in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% with human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulinglubsin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients can be reduced with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes in the effectiveness of the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-sensitive diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphine, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, the effect of sympathetic polymers such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidine and reserpine can be alleviated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglucisin and insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin sensitivity occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="2987">≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, headache, nausea, and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection range, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection of glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in the subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lucisin and the active time is shorter than in the normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellit- tus, insulin-lucisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg revealed a dose-proportional glucosity-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an inferior glucose-lowering effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lubsin has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a comparable post-pranic glycemic control is achieved in an application of insulin-lubsin 2 minutes before the meal, as with humanoid insulin analog, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If Insulinglubsin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-pranic control was achieved than with humanoid insulin analog 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved as with human insulin analog, which is given 2 middles before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin Low for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin analog, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin Low during administration 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human Normal ininsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1c).</seg>
