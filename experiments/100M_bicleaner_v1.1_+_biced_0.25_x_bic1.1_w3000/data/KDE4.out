&quot; &quot; &quot; the module website can be compiled in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; menu under Extras website . select from the drop @-@ down list the output and target language of the translation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the entire &amp; URL .
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated by the Bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ side itself , where you can insert texts to translate them directly .
package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; load settings , select Settings ... Open the tab tool@@ boxes and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard instruction modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View Filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View Filter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s current working directory in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root tip of the document , example : document@@ item , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the Special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View color mode , can either represent depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( whereby representation errors occur due to limitations in the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
for representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting entries of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
the implementation is left up to the implementation of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries . for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames , it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item View Ad@@ ding in Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Photo Gallery , a dialog opens , which allows you to define the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images per line has a slider bar and a screen@@ shot to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check box , you can specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in file selection save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
to include sub@@ folders with the check box , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; copy the original images to the gallery using the original images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original images &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the Navigation Pan@@ e can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under the Navigation Pan@@ e window or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu item to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , by which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser identi@@ fier into one of the following options .
changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that decline access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
sites that do not comply with the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and edit your photos directly in &amp; editing ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; editing ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also digi@@ code ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; nbsp ; When you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , join . you can answer here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; edit is to sign up in the developer mailing list . instructions for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list of &amp; editing ; .
when you start &amp; editing ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to store your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . simply enter path names or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data query is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; nbsp ; You will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains pictures as a base folder . no picture will be changed . no picture will be changed . while browsing the folder , you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ code ; search recur@@ sively the library path in its entirety . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . this can be done with extra @-@ nec@@ ks &amp; editing ; do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can configure your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help Roh@@ c@@ amer@@ a@@ Support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and edit your photos directly in &amp; editing ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digital cameras also support the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port is slow , this connection is in the meantime obsol@@ ete .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support for reliable reading of the preview images . the Ex@@ if support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do &amp; editing is how easy it can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Module : the K@@ DE Image plugin Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; editing ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; editing ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came in &amp; editing ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture can &apos;t be put in keywords , date list , or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works when this is also shown in the tool@@ view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ bar Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ sti@@ gt ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that are stored by &amp; editing are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Im@@ porting pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album Im@@ porting Screen Picture .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to give information about this collection . to access the album features , right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Collection : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos after collection from the tool@@ bar or sort albums After collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; nbsp ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ sti@@ gt ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might then want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; supports the entry of keyword for individual photos in the area My keywords list left in the main window . album collections have a different effect . to the collection are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a bit while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all preview images .
information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information is this can be edited by editing ; Set@@ ting up . select the Albums page here and customize the preview pictures to your li@@ king .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cur@@ sor at a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all editing &amp; editing . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can select all the features that have been editing &amp; editing . you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or selecting the right mouse button and selecting Edit ... menu . in the editing pane , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . you can view and edit your photos with image editing .
it can happen that &amp; editing ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , find information in &amp; bin ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image processing programs , it may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data with the same time you save the modified image . this will lose this information from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; editing ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right click on the preview and select rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
when you delete a photo from &amp; editing , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del Falls if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the View &amp; quot ; My data limit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; organize your photos based on the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the Date View , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
tag photos provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , &apos; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . additionally , the keywords are re @-@ imported as soon as the digi@@ code is lost ; the images will be noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ sample of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword using the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the images and select Key@@ word from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the menu item menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit .
you can enter a title in the field below and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amp , and even more in the future .
Neb@@ ras@@ er search box is a small lamp that becomes green when searching for matches . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criteria .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the header and search is done . the results are displayed in My search list in the main window . the text box Save as is used to select a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection after search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View menu and select an option in its context menu .
when you select to edit the search , the search form will return to the search information previously entered . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; editing ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added by line @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / Clear Search group . each option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; nbsp ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move or zo@@ oming in or out with the mouse wheel . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this implies , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
you can add a name for your ge@@ o filter in the field below . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ ous table from the context menu . the selection is added to the lumin@@ ous table and its window . if you are back in &amp; editing ; main window are , you can quickly open the lumin@@ table with L @-@ Tools .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you can select Pre@@ view from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the pictures , you will also compare the same area of both images .
another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a series of images . if you use combination @-@ wise to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the area for relo@@ ading . now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ ous table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it possible , for example , to link visual differences with exposure information .
at the bottom of each section , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to change the visible area of the picture , you must click and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works exactly the same way as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are offset in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes records , scans or digit@@ ally stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure , protect , protect and use your pictures . we focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; editing ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , optimi@@ zing , filing , storing , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management collects , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no inventory management to find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ code ; . the approach to saving the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is building up information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % are archives and 5 % working files and you will not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata ; to activate it . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which one ? to do so &amp; editing ; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs , or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; editing ; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . re@@ sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; editing ; updated as the sub @-@ trees are tra@@ cked .
the graph shows how different metadata overl@@ apped . this is a very crude representation , because each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
wow ! you start dreaming , having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others viewing your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a let@@ tering for itself to work alone .
with &amp; editing ; you can store as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . you can also put it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even exports you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images to web galleries , you will not have to tell the story a second time for publishing .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already at light speed .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with geographic information . this then shows the photos at the recording location .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a play of copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; editing ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture . this is very important for private individuals .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; nbsp ; It will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing .
topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , ast@@ er@@ ism diff@@ ra@@ ction , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t wait longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . despite this massive protective they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fail@@ over of hard drives for this topic : flo@@ ppy failure
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT may indicate the imminent failure . these are particularly read errors and shift counters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data due to a power loss before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause bru@@ ised key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware obsol@@ escence , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . remember , however , that not every connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , be sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks , so they are very small and you also have the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to continue working until the current is running again . if you buy an U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security during power disrup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; Dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data protection , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically corrected and included with the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed storage system .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file systems ensure at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been spotted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop , there is a natural border for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather impaired . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , save your data after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous like installing your operating system , changing disks or changing the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
thus disaster prevention always means a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up@@ stairs to the neighbour house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete sn@@ apshot at two points : that of the complete backup and the last difference security .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , Ke@@ ep original memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet .
in order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available to anyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollars ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block@@ quote ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adju@@ sts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a more complex editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web galleries , en@@ code to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the Camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; editing . in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an album , you will be able to add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting pictures to your source database .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ cam ; use it , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras , it may take a while . some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for any file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file features and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as the met@@ a @-@ met@@ a tool@@ bar from the main window of &amp; editing ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available on some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; editing ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected will be gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; editing yet . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you are using the buttons All or download Sel@@ ected , a dialog appears in which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; editing ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at a time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only a few , you must first select them and then delete the selected dele@@ tion .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be deleted in the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they will be deleted completely before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera cher , you should do so using the camera , because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the picture was made in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer , three other options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data on the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , in the edit field you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % H % H : % M : % S .
if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you will have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters when downloading . or in capital letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; editing ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your ren@@ ame settings are saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window .
&amp; nbsp ; Can you use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ ces ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Ex@@ tension button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; editing ; this is used to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date will be added to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , it stores &amp; editing ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced option and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the File selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; editing ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted by your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . determination of the data can be carried out by the US GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with one click , which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; editing , users want to document the location of the photos , or simply document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ ate coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; editing ; try to give you as much control over the work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of editing . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Edit menu ; Settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; editing ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the relevant IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be names such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as these are the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
IP@@ TC actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited &amp; edited without being lost .
save image labels as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images . this way , your let@@ tering can also be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; editing ; to indicate which file types &amp; editing have been attempted , you can add and edit the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
these settings can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the lumin@@ escent , these settings are turned on when possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling this means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as P@@ NG uses loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time to pack and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high compression .
comp@@ ress the TI@@ FF images with the TI@@ FF file . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ position algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the relationship between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; editing ; image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at present , it quickly becomes a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is to capture the pointed candles , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed candles . use the setting through white in the settings . the setting colors will create some unusual results , as they will attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general don &apos;t satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; editing ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your li@@ king . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing &amp; editing image options . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ged@@ don small , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ged@@ don algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; editing ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks so . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was used for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction since you are carried out during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return them . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; editing ; information how to translate color information from one color space to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Pu@@ t the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ fully managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon that do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . at present , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma isn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon Profile Expansion sets the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; editing ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of the available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then removed by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the Main Window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper controls adjust the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features on the left side provide a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture display mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check out whether &amp; editing ; the camera detects automatically . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the Main Window C@@ ameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash@@ b@@ ins , you can display &amp; edit the dialog ; to delete a picture in an album . in the blan@@ king of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly triggered by &amp; editing ; apply if you use the option Chan@@ ges in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also edit the display of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welcome Screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this speeds up &amp; editing the boot process under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the setting Start after new pictures is forcing &amp; editing ; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of editing &amp; editing ; if anything from the base folder was deleted , asked &amp; editing ; you see if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be edited &amp; edited in order to adjust the main window to your preferences . you can select these settings under settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available themes will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; editing ; create , find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; editing ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the preview and selection of the preview and selection of the entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; editing ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions , however , will change the original photo before using file Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you may need to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can do this with File Storage .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu or the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last store .
almost any image processing action can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting undo or Rest@@ oring by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you are using this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and re@@ connect C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB file a moment longer via the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you start the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu File . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically .
view Full Screen displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you are using the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change this in the editing dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image pages can be prin@@ tet from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print job from the Edit Audio menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
editing &amp; editing ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
in the ann@@ ot@@ ation view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are re @-@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the rating is written in the ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the Key@@ word tree , and a choos@@ er box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; editing ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of keywords in a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by checking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are keyword stored in the keyword field .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the Key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a sample with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Fil@@ l section .
the Key@@ word Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and searches . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and store keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right @-@ word tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
if you have a rule with and created , and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options will then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly on &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result .
if your picture workflow comp@@ lies with all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image output is by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB &apos;s limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sti@@ cker my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor , as s@@ RGB indicates that your ; on@@ itor is bri@@ gh@@ tened on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to sti@@ cker your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . so use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same way : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity can be as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new acoustic of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; editing ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited there is a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can move too far from the original image areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right there is a hist@@ ogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result displayed in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Store buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and relo@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will create another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , comp@@ ut@@ ational time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be carried through the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color management .
another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&amp; nbsp ; The color effects tool provides you with four color effects , a solar @-@ animation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when printing a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . this was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar cell . at about 50 % of intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ o@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color trac@@ ts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool tone @-@ value correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the application explained here . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected range . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the regulator and to take care of how the image changes .
on the right , you can look at the original and preview the image . the preview will be updated dynamic , based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively modify the output values as in the input values . compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and relo@@ ad later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , remedies and sun sounds . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured using a digital camera , linear mode is the most sensual . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you shift a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and the image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your li@@ king .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sunny tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find over@@ exposed pixels in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sunny notes were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; editing channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve colour channels or change color shades .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right bottom : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , because the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when mixing mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . color@@ less consists of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save and load buttons are used for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography , black and white is a working step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ ther Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange @-@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filters .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of day . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color shade correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ thel@@ ia : produces warm light and medium sounds while adding a bit of cold into the shade tree . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ qui@@ at@@ onic . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sc@@ ab@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; editing tool ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth resp@@ . three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief measures have been set to 200 .
with the &amp; editing ; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the confin@@ es of a photograph is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye . under picture frames the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . passing through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce bor@@ dered it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , it is bor@@ dered with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ing effect and decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio earlier .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any position . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; editing ; use tool templates you can put a template over a picture .
the Picture Sch@@ abl@@ one menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; edit , send an email in English to &amp; nbsp ; mailing list digi@@ code @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your templates folder with the base folder in the dialog . here , select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears , reflecting the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the preview tool@@ bar .
below the preview are three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button is sc@@ aled down the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you will need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; has three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to look shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it does a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process needs to combine colours with minimal differences to a color point . elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras typically need more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already using a field of focus during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the Fol@@ low Advertising module . you can call this with the Con@@ duc@@ ting Fol@@ low menu .
you should be careful , however , as the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for soft sign with the Con@@ duc@@ ting Soft drawing and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and thumb@@ nail help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges are generated .
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image being added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , one can define a minimum difference to be used for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore , beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the invisible mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ ry mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; editing ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted de@@ coding @-@ filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the picture . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing mostly achieves better results than blur@@ red .
in practice , the circular folds are much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ el@@ es , which are far from the original source pixels . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is affected very strongly from the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folds . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation decreases the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radi@@ us for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blu@@ r is aggressive . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular acuity or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , be aware that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set is saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform any cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by making the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharp@@ ness .
in theory , un@@ sharp masks always have to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filters , it is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture was taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing knob accentu@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pu@@ pill@@ ary .
the tin@@ ted ink permits an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab@@ s smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
attention conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values can be smoo@@ thed in homo@@ geneous regions and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional conditional alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD &apos;s , a high value will produce sha@@ ft@@ like patterns . JPEG Arti@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should make this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . every setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . hence , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how to remove picture errors with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is an odd black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; editing ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular h@@ um that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details of the sub@@ window and the Advanced settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blu@@ ff the image . the area specified by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter to the front to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , you may need to adjust the edges filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the Adap@@ tive Filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubric@@ ate res@@ umes again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove all noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the max@@ im if you want to remove a weak sp@@ lash or j@@ peg @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance level of the image . we advise you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more strongly smoked . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter range re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter will appear at the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied to default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use the tool for soft sign with the Con@@ duc@@ ting Soft drawing and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; noise , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the texture replacement is carried out using a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons make it exactly this way . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and relo@@ aded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ e .
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise will be reduced .. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the pixel animation of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and thumb@@ nail help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate those pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; editing ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor of 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which may possibly increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise lack of sharp@@ ness caused by motion .
with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or grey level depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a picture without this filter . the tool is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ il@@ ance correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image using the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; editing ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ il@@ ance correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a light and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but flat@@ ly edges on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost .
general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree of distortion . with negative values , distortion causes can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth gra@@ dient . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameters &apos; has the inver@@ ted acci@@ dent@@ als of the parameter General .
zoom : this value re@@ scales the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview around the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ y / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form Con@@ tri@@ mming from image editing or via the zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below previ@@ ew@@ ing you can adjust two parameters of film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Fü@@ ge movie grain if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sharp@@ sho@@ oters .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can be calibr@@ ated with the sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon@@ iz@@ ze . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ code ; filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; editing ; Fil@@ ters engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ eng@@ es 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Be@@ e .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blu@@ r : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blu@@ r : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
sof@@ tening blu@@ r : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random@@ ly shifting the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photograph in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling it with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ e .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ s protected by copyright .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image .
you can stick with the &amp; editing ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can fix it by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning and Trans@@ forming Spi@@ der menu .
photo capturing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ locate or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
change the size of the tool using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to close the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow it up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; nbsp ; ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo was blown off by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ber effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ ot@@ ation for photo can be saved as text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ e .
you can see below an example of photo blown by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
editing a photo is not just a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to trim a photo you just have to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be gra@@ yed out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by clicking with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save file or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
when cutting the aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool In aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly aid make it possible to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third principle , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonious tri@@ angles towards the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational figure 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spir@@ als . it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that as opposed to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ aled tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you take a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; editing ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with slider corners . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is to cut the function Automati@@ cally . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option leaves the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the reference point so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is shifted slightly . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you will get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
the sh@@ oring tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left .
select your image by using the horizontal and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point like e.g. the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after the sc@@ aling is done , the picture gets blur@@ red a bit . for a single sho@@ oter this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two canc@@ ell@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&amp; editing ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats will therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; edit .
because of this dependence of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; editing ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is based on the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is specified in the list , it will be edited &amp; edited ; you can change this list of file extensions , edit it . see the configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; nbsp ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you would like to learn more about the raw image format , you can read in English by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images into JPEG or TI@@ FF with the blank screen converter .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; supports loading raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; editing ; included . hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format , but is not a film editing program and does not have any built @-@ in movies to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; edit , use settings to play movies to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have walked back before .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to make the photo editing need to be edited in &amp; edited ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft sign , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally cut without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move or zo@@ oming in or out with the mouse wheel . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this implies , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k ; Settings and Hot Custom Color and Rec@@ ently used colors .
in the Palette dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is checked at the Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor button below the button color , the color is inserted from the colour plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ ph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are based on the program author &apos;s view and X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewers ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Plac@@ ed ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; ates ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewers ; displays )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate , or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewers ; to open in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required are :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewers ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can choose from the context menu a fixed position of this overview , or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with press &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has been changed from another program just in &amp; k@@ wer@@ case , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph should be relo@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can also make use of the settings menu item k@@ alli@@ viewers ; set up ... use it , see also .
when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; c@@ low@@ viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; to open the instance or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both save and later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether parts of the graph that come to one page should be adapted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a row distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ able loading page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewers ; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time requested .
the session management page provides the ability to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewers ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or specify to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphical ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :

the K@@ IP@@ I module reads images and provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you must have installed K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e .
when you scan the menu entry images , a dialog appears , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ er &apos;s default setting to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen sn@@ ap@@ shots can be created after selecting the Im@@ porting &gt; Screen Picture ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ o@@ modes :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been taken , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family around the world .
the Ex@@ porter to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authenti@@ fication , so it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched to allow you to log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r homepage . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes , you will get the dialog for upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button pictures should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as tags during the upload .
with the options Publi@@ sh , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before the upload , the photos will be changed before upload in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum amount of images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the geographic location K@@ IP@@ I module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the image &apos;s EX@@ IF keyword and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic location module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the dialog shown above appears then . to get a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which shows coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the maximum time devi@@ ation setting gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera zone . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually using this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the appropriate region and zoom si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ p to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an HTML page gallery to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will appear the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , eg . Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . to do this , select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ 5 , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other Color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the programs to determine if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG video en@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG @-@ Sli@@ deshow . then you can start creating the module via extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the pictures you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the pictures or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file by name of the MPEG output file . keep as much as possible as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your needs , you can start the creation of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if an indication appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings on the right below .
print Wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ mp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG feature has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them further , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the option to automatically over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ code and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . add more images via the pictures button . for the last image selected , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent .
with the pictures button , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
do not take too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the pictures into a text file and the mail is enclosed .
the P@@ NG format under the Image file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG below image file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will , however , be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL Transfer option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option to show fil@@ en@@ ames ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the Ri@@ b@@ bon option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually stop using Es@@ c .
selecting images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used in the order of the images in the album .
between the pictures , the temporal gap between the pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect during each transition between the images .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause and start the presentation again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons can be seen will be shown . this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area of work .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right @-@ hand side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
you must , however , decide which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the picture view window ( described in more detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . in the View window , you can customize the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can customize the image for the respective person .
when you visit the Find entry in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the let@@ tering or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the full date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures depicting Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time or select the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name says , this line shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the Tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview section ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas : content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the title and a description to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . you will find useful information about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear why this is not specifically discussed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 no longer download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all been related to base @-@ folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder will be created in these settings , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to share your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a great deal of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in tw@@ o@@ fold mode . first , it searches through the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures is described , which you can access via the Export ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manual copy option close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; k photo@@ album to the Automati@@ cally near the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images are automatically copied to you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum picture size . if you send your friends images , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting ... menu , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the Im@@ porter for Im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen in the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) browsing and watching , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are stored and used it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , which allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up whole member groups , i.e. , all members of a group at one time in a group , instead of explaining all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as explained .
in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ code and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own images .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply fits to the current view , so all the images that show you the image preview right now .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do so , so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the settings dialog and select modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to every other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain much information as you have not yet received any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add comments to each picture . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . , for example , you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box , you can set people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pictured , you can , therefore , that the names used are moved up to find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multi@@ lingual entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window displaying the United States as a super@@ group . to show you that this is a sub@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this implies that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that make the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simple clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ o@@ ving button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , use pictures without having you saved on the hard drive . of course you have to have saved the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be uploaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would like to avoid irritation like the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to save all the images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who wish to make others in@@ accessible and click on &quot; Current View &quot; in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister is allowed to view and unlock everything except current view .
this allows you to decide which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand all pictures on the hard drive and on the other can read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the image , but additional information you have to enter via the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the information box at the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed . all of these options are available right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images uploaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image and the image of the buttons . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the Plus button zo@@ oms zoom into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom sp@@ eck is selected and shows the zo@@ oms result .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button , zo@@ oms zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos do in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and Minu@@ Key .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you can look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the image configuration dialog to enter these names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with characteristics , while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in that you press the corresponding letter . in this image you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all the comments to you . this is described in the following . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview mode . if you can view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album allows you to paint on the picture .
the folder will not be saved with the image , but in the database .
in order to end the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation too &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ property of an object already selected , since all sub@@ items are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then , you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ set item ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window over or under an existing view , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to place multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the An@@ f@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... save it . a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 present . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The symbol ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene render .
a render @-@ mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode .
in the font size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section of the sub@@ section and enter the picture cut@@ out into the input fields .
in the Quality Com@@ bin@@ ation field you can select the properties , which &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of render features can be found in the user manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling is the adjacent pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is again and again divided further and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ lam@@ ation angle depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified pixels , then both pixels are processed by tracking an additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , R 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch on , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays at a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this tab , you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the related rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray player , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the object &apos;s source code to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not located in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object of the d@@ ots to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid seper@@ ately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the ground , a floor is rendered beneath the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page , you can change existing window settings or create new window arrangements . in the window classi@@ fications section , you can explain how to create and store window arrangements .
the default window arrangement : displays all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at startup of the program .
the Custom window classi@@ fications list shows all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created by the Add button and selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window beneath the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . there@@ with you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you click on the Apply button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change instantly according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ tion End@@ less body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to resolve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited end level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the horizontal as a unit , just in order to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how to paste the object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the preview button see how the pigment looks now .
of course you can preview the pig@@ ments just a matte black material because you still have to enter settings for the pig@@ mentation . so , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
always mon@@ ochro@@ me in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to perform this step simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : 1 ( do not forget the input button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ property and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ments . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the settings of gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities are yours &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affecting . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you watch the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered takes some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ produces the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been disc@@ arded since the last saved time .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used undo .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new configuration or over@@ ride an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based , by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the Func@@ tioning of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the key short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays thumb@@ nail images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no more browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; editing ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to make at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ shot ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you issues or wishes . this displays a dialogue with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ If you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ You can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; but in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to take part in &amp; show photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ screen@@ shot in the menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; cann@@ on ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes scanning and scanning images .
&amp; cann@@ on ; is a simple application for scanning images that do no longer scan and save images . &amp; channel lite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a given folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed in the terminal at the command line . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . Canc@@ el &amp; Qu@@ it . exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; h@@ exag@@ ons ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not specifically handle these options .
to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and scan scan area for the final scan . preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? s will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview has to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; chant ; to save images . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; cann@@ lite ; it is automatically saved with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save , without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved and is also the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is added up each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE support with the &amp; chant manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE through dialog for &amp; chant ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; chant .

the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialogue so that the user does not know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as base for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the default scripts of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is picked up . the script could now b &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files , if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also be passed to enable the script to use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b may have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be comp@@ acted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the generating amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ end . for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just want to find a very specific title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to experience your music anew !
usually , you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any difficulties in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ u@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several learning flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition to the playlist , the player window will turn on or off the player window . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting Table : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
make it more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
tuning files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the preferences folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
make the current piece visible when changing pieces causes the playlist to open / down to keep the running track always visible in the visible window area .
when changing part to the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Set@@ ting custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist , player window and context browser .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated among them for foreground and background color .
playback at startup causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , resume playing automatically with the piece on the spot with which it was stopped at the last exit .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the Shadow pane allows the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if own colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the audio output tab allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate additional settings in this flash@@ card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder you want to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the ti@@ cked as well as their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setting is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under machine : if the machine is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use user name : and password : to enter the data needed for the connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to convey the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
to retrieve similar sounds : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ts to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including programs included in it , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide to minim@@ ise k@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager controls the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will lead to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens when it comes to a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to make Amar@@ ok the right version first .
you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in mind only one mistake , if something is wrong with the correction of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come into play there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the start sub @-@ window was converted to the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; click on the list box of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press De@@ f on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop them down , just as you would like to do with other files . as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add button , you can save the playlist button . click on it .
you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the actual question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 dec@@ lines are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Options Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously play audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to provide another link ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ware ) .
that does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first need to be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server operated with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
for K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you don &apos;t use the arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use any other driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less carriers respond to the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and crashes . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all the components . run the registry to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( complete Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute ff@@ m@@ peg file , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the recently @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions or requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm follow this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find out the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles when you are on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the current part : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP address and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window . to do so , press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the title of a browser . you can select which browser to display in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS disk . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio @-@ CD in the menu . it will open a file browser with multiple folders . to read the normal read , change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from folder mp3 or o@@ gg instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this is the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less impact each individual rating on the overall result .
you can change the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the Play@@ list window . then you can change the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select Review or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Edit Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a defined plan of publishing that is not compatible with the proposed Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find even annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click New Design Inst@@ all ...
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane allows you to monitor and control of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; browse Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add am@@ aro@@ k in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes resulting in a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . hence , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution , which inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ s if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get an error of There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must also have the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 @-@ stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Settings of Amar@@ ok ... Audio output will insert the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio
set us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . of course , you are allowed to take this issue yourself into your hands ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tainer for Arts : )
listening to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that is displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . use the mouse to create entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the click of the button Save Play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways how the playlist should be loaded .
to play an audio CD , please select Action Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD feature uses the audio oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . here you have several options to burn a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else .
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display indicating the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be dis@@ connected from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q knob is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control , and the play position slider . use the slider to set the piece position or volume . with the Play buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the E@@ Q button in the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer will be in operation .
the playlist of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of features deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right side is the playlist itself .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to each different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window launch has fallen away . the information shown there is now distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context @-@ browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set what information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on any of the pieces in each area to start playing right away . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text below , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , you will be able to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button enables you to edit the song text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this purpose .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and further division is performed according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ co@@ ctions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are listed alphabe@@ tically together . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically detect your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , it might take a while .
there is a search filter directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year . you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter practically shut down .
by right @-@ clicking on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
loading - This records the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach the playlist to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . they are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter to CD - This will allow the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cre@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in different interpre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high@@ lighting the compilation @-@ mark - Change a album marked as compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer under different interpre@@ ts , but again under the matching interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists can also be created . simply click Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to be able to use , for example , your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod as performer in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the performer list . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file @-@ browser , there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a given URL . if you enter the tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z for example , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will insert cas@@ eless files automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping them . clicking on the playlist will show only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , then &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one in two , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , place a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR View : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key and clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add to the playlist . to the right , you &apos;ll find the playlist , empty playlist , and Rand@@ om M@@ ics .
next , the buttons will return and restore , so you can undo or restore any changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you will get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for tool@@ bars , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for chance mode and retri@@ eval , a slider for the player position and the game time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . des@@ elect the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . you can use this menu to reach the Settings of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by choosing actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your large entrance into &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( details on setting up these two later ) .
fill your playlist with random items from your entire collection and add other random items during playback .
add pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on you and then select Shop . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces begin with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces are added at the next batch change , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . via the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist will open the playlist to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you will have the ability to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens for editing the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed in line with the settings played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , it will add &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; random items from each of the play@@ lists you are using .
some scripts let you customize your settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking Con@@ figuration .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts , by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . once you have installed the script , a new script will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted , then Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you would like to burn an audio CD of MP3 &apos;s or other los@@ sy formats then remember that when encoding to MP3 you will get a po@@ orer quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this quick reference should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; -@@ Settings , press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD contents ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore chooses &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality of burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis encoding and en@@ coder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
fla@@ c : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , fla@@ c , nut@@ shell decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature @-@ packed auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without normal@@ isation , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between Save and Chan@@ ges . you can also ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you had called for each project file close .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what should happen , as if you had called file C@@ lose .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the dialog that appears . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can view the files and folders already available on the media .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you then can burn sometime later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows to copy a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn at some time later . additionally , the copy of a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all the contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes Rev@@ en@@ ue and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and trim black borders .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk or ej@@ ection of the media .
the content view also allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header line is a narrow section which is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights will be required , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; general program settings can be made here . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , therefore your taste and type of your task is more important than that of the provided programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to create a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ cker / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; it can easily be read audio CDs ; it can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and supported by many en@@ co@@ ders which en@@ code these wa@@ v files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is supported by default .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress in the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ g ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ang any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handles the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection .
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , it will be explained later by the daily use for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work entirely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
if the CD@@ DB file requests the CD data subject to the creation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the Settings @-@ Settings tab - the encoding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . it should be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the Settings dialog tab in the encoding settings .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , blank ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; finished ) .
Creator opens the &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator main direction dialogue ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ co@@ ders , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important as both co@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo equipment . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et ultra &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the unit . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et ultra -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add title to the keywords if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to be set up by fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to do so ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s. to note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the coding and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the encoding . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the applicable Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers is in the chapter Wel@@ sh Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a coding , more information can be obtained from its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code@@ c of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; to read out . check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure of what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine , as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg by trying to copy it into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what each read &amp; CD must be repeated .
here we determine the code@@ c to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time when reading a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information request , so that you will be informed when information is missing for creating keywords ( tags ) .
the Kar@@ sten Card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work first .
both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls default the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the 80@@ 80 protocol , since the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp file exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not ti@@ cked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo equipment . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as default for each read of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section .
since we have a &amp; CD ; don &apos;t use it in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successful from fre@@ ed@@ b de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually input data instead of picking them out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , search for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the unit in the first line of the &apos; Now Tit@@ le &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input field , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
caution : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD Editor is not empty but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you will have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum . this option is set on the encoding settings section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . look at the help to get more information .
simply select an entry that matches the style of the read @-@ only CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will unlock or out the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All items on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a co@@ efficient you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we &apos;ve typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first play .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this makes reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read out and code . with weak machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left corner of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; if you know CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it features screen@@ shots of the various settings of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD on the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it all about ? if you are reading this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended to do so . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange , if you succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , who is needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; end while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also let a file of a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window fall into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the Play pause from the menu or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it is added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playing speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when one piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the piece , interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is determined automatically , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to specify an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played back in the series . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , it appears the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu option sequence of the Colle@@ ctions Colle@@ ctions , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next song , the next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI capability . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and will always let a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary modifications for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as requested . prerequis@@ ite for this is , however , that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equality symbol is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument requires . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun . to do so , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term &apos; drum patch &apos; , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped to a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ map for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used above all to map tones to the percussion channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ words as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives the keyboard that a pitch Ben@@ der event is supposed to play with the value 40@@ 96 , a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI Settings . you will find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the channel View menu : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force no one , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen when you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid , compiled without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; co@@ de ; Desktop 1 &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) . in this way , when the collection is finished or I want to play a file , just change into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the window and drag the desired file into &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . open files
let &apos;s assume you have MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ A. and C.@@ A. . first , you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ A. . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ A. and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid , written completely in my free time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E tickets .

and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view pictures . you will also find links to pages with additional kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music of course .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that are supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only appear when information is to be returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical student . when you click on an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and as next editing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , the Play@@ list menu must be selected using Play@@ list , selecting either the editing mode , or selecting another category .
all changes are lost when the processor is left or another group is selected without the same as the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / .x@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ v . sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; In the package testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another feature for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in &amp; K@@ M@@ Player &apos;s configuration dialog . everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even em@@ bed the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there is no error here , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to ensure that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should restore all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the Video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be working properly . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ . , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ sc@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ob source .
is there any clu@@ es on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when playing from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ s -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as root after the device has been inserted . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom refers to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why must my CPU be checked for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support , and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be resor@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; respectively ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution ; the installation should include the documentation of the distribution / installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for the documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; website .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within that a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book about it . at &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
document categories : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
code : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only have to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ents of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in the preparation of German texts .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source @-@ text editors - the emphasis on the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see deeper areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , an empty line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) will be created automatically when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ; Set@@ ting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ cut@@ aneous element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file recovery may be very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the native output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print out DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ pped to the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on @-@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large boxes should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division include :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , gro@@ ut notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , image or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary input . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; box ; written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ The e is used for defining the font . it can be set the fon@@ ts for the main text , the gro@@ unding notes , etc .
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and determining the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the character set . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the button fast construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; removes the file automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , you should look for errors in the logging . if you use fast construction , you should automatically start &amp; use ey@@ epi@@ ece . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the letter size e 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the change of the fon@@ ts to be done within the environment .
the changes will only be supervised in the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes in an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with an \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows after the background is presented for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ;
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quote , a few passages in the bold and bold print and a poem to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) using File Print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ selection search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , simply set up the Modern under Settings box ... Tools construction will be selected .
to search for the preview , the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then click on the preview . the jump to the appropriate spot in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and applied to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; Set as Text Editor ( Settings Ok@@ ular ... Editor )
should errors occur when using fast building of the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be summari@@ zed in the log file or message window .
the log file will indicate the source of the error in the source code . in the editor , the buttons Previous La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document . more information about this can be found in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by making an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if an easy way to create a template , you should search for a template on the Internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when you click on \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the different types of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can create additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items edit jump stamps or the corresponding push buttons make the jump to the next or last jump . this jump marker is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is always supported &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the slots are separated by two blank lines .
this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has an extended meaning , since this command also has a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands are included to delete the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands in the Edit area for a common simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command closes the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . in the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit area .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current batch ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or behind the bra@@ i@@ ded par@@ enth@@ esis of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many welded groups clas@@ ps , the overview can be quickly lost . this command closes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple add @-@ on signs are used as a tool . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; box ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple indication signs . also for the end of the application , the character &quot; is used .
this automatic double opt @-@ in sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings ( e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; german or French &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and therefore English or French &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German or French &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holding shift ; enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close in a table environment , complete t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . at the bottom of Shift ; Alt ; ramp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab is not the corresponding , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the back button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the completion list can be moved . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are also removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump stamps can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing jumps and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings C@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different types of works for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders as well as native speakers of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for completing environments . it always has to be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the execution mode will result in a large e list with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments is available .
when calling the complete operating environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically initi@@ alled to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and finished by pressing the input button .
once this has been completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; box ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the full list of execution mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of cut @-@ outs , which are immediately replaced by more expensive strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word ver@@ acity mode is initiated via the menu item C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Location , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large e @-@ mail users are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many rights in a document are written more than once . thus &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete compensation for all rights already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings box ... Can be shut down . here also the threshold value for displaying the complete damage can be specified .
the files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphi@@ cs dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to review the basis for graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed group@@ wise into the menu creation , create conversion and create views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the other transformation can be used the Alt @-@ 2 key ; after that , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file by means of old ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the fast build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will pop up each time .
a new project is about the men@@ ue project New Project .... The following information is requested for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ osk file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not yet been developed and can be changed into other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a large number of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with a lot of documents , including documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete re@@ inde@@ er for &amp; tex ; and a full @-@ bodied co @-@ operation . this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application text doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents &amp; ki@@ cks ; delivered documents and here a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the increased advantage is searching for package names or key words . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; includes many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . do we add it one piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no more relies on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the sub@@ folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the currently open file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file choos@@ er .
if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ For@@ med , then click Well @-@ For@@ med check selection .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the place of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file choos@@ er . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for Relax@@ NG checking is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er file .
specify the name of the file , as the result is to have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which are called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves possibly have little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and don &apos;t have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , use this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event can be created for the information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc .
event Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see from the add@@ res@@ see list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
enter comments is easy . it can be selected either the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by Not@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to an identi@@ fiable member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the specified nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will only find information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for others can be found .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including code completion may be changed . entries are :
large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of tags inserted . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : when checked , tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
automatically update start and finish tag : when enabled , the corresponding final tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic set @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the identification of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be stab@@ bed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document from this backup can be restored during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the standard when the next start is useful when the user interface has been modified by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of non @-@ compliance .
the location around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , the current frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded while editing text . abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plu@@ gins can be managed by third @-@ party plug @-@ ins , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a stand@@ ar like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in the &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses the loading . only @-@ Read @-@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as to whether the entered information is correct . un@@ select allows to save the application even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the de@@ bu@@ gger &apos;s supported functions , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to the de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it in the normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is p@@ aus@@ ed , the execution proceeds .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , whereby , if possible , it will be correctly adjusted in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Island as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how to make you better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , capabilities like code completion and K@@ not@@ enb@@ ahn . their simplicity and flexibility make from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the day folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder includes two file types , the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which add text and instructions to a document faster than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a writing fault .
tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of tag XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all of them are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as one @-@ element type over itself nothing else .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( Family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags describing how this attribute is supposed to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a merely item type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but be careful &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . leaving this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog on the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . dialog . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not currently available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ .@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... and created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action is assigned short@@ cuts . clicking on the user defined button can be assigned to assign a short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer , the current key symbol is removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following locations tries : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to the default input . in the input field , you can specify what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected portion of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output drop output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start the editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog if available so that an input when using the action is possible .
exit ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ Software ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size It@@ em .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually marked as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , indicate a message to the user that clicking on this icon will paste ; start ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar and set the tool@@ bar to select the tool bar . make sure the tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup to the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository whether someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ ent Section 1 = section 2.@@ html ...
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the PHP documentation ; documentation is something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; Fol@@ der is shown ! ) .
space characters do nothing , but be careful &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ ce@@ e files .
the content section is the area of the doc file which is used to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if you want to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function by checking the function name and pressing of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / var / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc@@ arded resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an email @-@ send menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team considers them as correct and useful for publication . to make an extra contribution , we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can fill in the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) from the D@@ TE@@ P menu , upload tool bar tool bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , checks &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML language , which is currently not currently supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be required . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Download and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ war@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a number of key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you have to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts first . this chapter seeks to famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , little use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , em@@ o@@ g@@ gling the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the tree view , the check@@ ers with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , relo@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file if the string below the cur@@ sor describes a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; insert into your document then click on the symbol that represents the day . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . should you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the Archit@@ ec@@ tures ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with multip@@ liers stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views available .
project management is a powerful tool called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the contex@@ tual menu then displayed .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; field . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ down in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre@@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate section of tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to modify files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why development what someone else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers to expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible for almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on templates . if you attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , converts special characters to &amp; html ; sc@@ rolling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; sc@@ rolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost , to paste &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of the scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
on and off of the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol columns to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ bla@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this enables , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in proj@@ ectors / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
this creates a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... or they will be saved by tool tracks tool bars or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; It is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day preferences dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ref@@ using tool bars when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the Po@@ sters ; -@@ version .
very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is tab card mode , which is also the default setting , or sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
display the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help in the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be selected using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ page ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ cam ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate choice of cou@@ pon code .
this shows a list of the files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or Shift @-@ F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are read@@ ing@@ ently ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described .
up@@ loading profiles can be set in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by sh@@ utting its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the Event Con@@ figuration menu , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment .
to open another project , choose Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ cam as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project management provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder will behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is required and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk Save option is not eligible .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers .
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a hazard . use it at your discretion . the password is hidden on the disk so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are custom@@ is@@ able ; the best thing about the tool@@ bar menu . use and add differ . adding tool bars will be treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the icons on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created ; other actions can be executed like tool@@ bar , ren@@ ame tool bar or set tool bars , which can be specified , which actions should be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set Settings ... set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a standard file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in roughly the limitations you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be binary any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are ne@@ sted in accor@@ dant sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate As a local template store ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As presentation save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , the project folder will be backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / var / var / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / var / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders equ@@ als one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once el@@ ter@@ ial attributes have been acquired .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template list . if a root folder would be set in such a way , it would disable templates in this path unless explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or added text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copy of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second tells the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back if necessary to the source editor , in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which &amp; PHP ; includes , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ PL image of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the key pressure changes the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keywords keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
cur@@ sors may be used as in word processing , moving with arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves odd . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bars , such as the source text editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other anchor day .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to successfully compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , you need other libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g comp@@ utes the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top uploaded style file with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a command called QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; cap agrees with any QNAP or template containing the template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools for comparison . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many points . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no hint at the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the automatic selection of the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder consolidation :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check the code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed promin@@ ently . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make typing work easier by exec@@ uting only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows the manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
over the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is ti@@ cked , the input field for the target is active and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button will open a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to pull text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains , for example , several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then load them and compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare them .
note : currently , you cannot extract from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source file contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file does not have lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for the next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this also causes a jump of the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes , by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing , no more line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the row . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; crash conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the options , Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ v as you can also use it from other programs .
in the input window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Cont@@ acts section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image up@@ side / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , you automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copy is dropped . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line end@@ ings are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep track of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved when you exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Con@@ figuration - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays font with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight away . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically create an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the previous line ind@@ entation will be automatically applied to the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others will only look identical to a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , you will be able to use different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jump @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before continuing to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are covered in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already one such backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
modify the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally dis@@ connected via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
in the selection fields for the encoding , a short note appears , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to use for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ ; C will be displayed next to the normal one , a second overview column with the information you need .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . up @-@ to @-@ date file mer@@ ges in the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which exactly matches your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line offset to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression of all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first string . \ \ &apos; converts the found text in upper@@ case .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ations . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several repairs at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are kept for viewing and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the line ab@@ lation al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that modi@@ fies text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and , in the worst case , destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... carries selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that time will be listed .
when scanning the folder , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or double @-@ click the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as you can see in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging and storing the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option of selecting New file rather than mer@@ ging ( uns@@ afe ) is checked , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not fixed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is executed after the other . you status column displays finished when mer@@ ging is successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happened . when mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK all over .
if the file comparison method is full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all join actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ merge Mode C is used as a target , in the two @-@ folder consolidation , B is selected as the target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all the entries , select Start / Continu@@ e in the menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key symbol ) . to bring only the current item , select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
when non@@ conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid coher@@ ence actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select start / resume folder consolidation or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; your work continues with the next entry .
if you crash on a fault , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before continuing together .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will not see any entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again at a later date . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory link@@ age with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter several patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid place holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid place holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
with links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not containing possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al the Date Modi@@ fied . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this may be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are later identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the later file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the Fol@@ der merge view will remain visible to the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can split the directory &amp; text window into the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text windows .
you may also prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu . you can also merge a single file directly , without first having to merge the folder .
this status is lost though , if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters have to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # uses the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date differ from the original . ( note the Option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P starts first and foremost the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In@@ de@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assume that the file is a patch file in the unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select &quot; Pre@@ view &quot; from the Con@@ text Menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file is created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing files is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st it comp@@ lies ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long ago and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character differs , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing list .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update feature . )
only entries are displayed showing differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C let@@ tering under the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within a desktop as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and Be@@ ams . if , however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , Desktop and Be@@ e . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
clicking on this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to indicate the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed with name , the names will be given with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here you can specify the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N grid , such as p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ tops are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their content .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... let the dialog settings appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root , or log in to your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the basic K@@ DE packages .

you can use &amp; kiss ; magni@@ fy a part of the screen , as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; Kiss , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described below as selection window .
in the default setting &amp; C@@ ases ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mov@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , press or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can shift the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set of short commands to save files , open a new window , print , relo@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and small &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can magni@@ fy &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use a magni@@ fying section to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and who prepares pain every mou@@ sec@@ lick .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor freezes in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick is causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer should also be caused by pain . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief items , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you stop the motion short .
if the smart move is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button exec@@ utes . in this way , you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . this way you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; exec@@ utes a mouse @-@ click .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting @-@ shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button , before releasing the mouse button , when no moving of the mouse is done .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , creates a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click here the General tab . there is a sli@@ m@@ bar sound buffer that you can set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset after the last push of Apply .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in tune with sounds .
first , you should be aware at which points a mou@@ sec@@ lick remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not provide a link does not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in a different location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor in where you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of the mouse and eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark this way text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart move when you just start using k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and holding the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when intelligent moving the move time begins . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . however , it requires some practice .
um &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor stops briefly . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a dra@@ gging process to begin before releasing the mouse button . in this way , pulling and dropping using the mouse can also be done .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that lets mu@@ te users let their computers speak for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program &amp; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose phrases that are to be spoken again from a list with the conversation progress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) defines the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
when you mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory channel . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry , set up ... open the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ TT@@ SD language service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the text output input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , set the character encoding to pass the text to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
when it is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ t@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage Book menu or in the bar for text passage books .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and inserted in addition to the exp@@ ander memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only in the input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the second selection box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ lose the editing window for text passage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you select Chan@@ ges , the text@@ book will not be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved .
word Supp@@ lement contains a list of words for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the dictionary that is currently used for word completion .
using buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the record . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; mouth ; newly inserted words automatically add to the dictionary , over time you create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to edit text passage books is split . in the upper part , text passage books are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by pulling with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ander .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ander .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ander .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passage books with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably haven &apos;t entered the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings to mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the voice output command . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the voice output command then reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to freely use Free@@ T@@ TS without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ry , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which will appear in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a speech generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the speech generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can let text output through the computer . it stores a list of pro@@ filed sentences that the user can re @-@ spend time and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech syn@@ thesizer . a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found using help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ array mailing list . subscribe to the list on ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ bin .
before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the speech tool by speech @-@ disp@@ cher .
at the first start of t@@ m@@ gr , or as long as no speakers have been set up , the card holder will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the tab card General is shown .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spo@@ kes@@ man in kt@@ mu@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the card is displayed automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top performer is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
at the click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
select here a type of voice , three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; almost use . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ats ; use to create text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language learning system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab General to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succ@@ eeds , the tab card will appear and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if t@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it will run &amp; kt@@ ats ; next , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear when reading in the Control bar &apos;s system area , it will disappear once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start , stop , pause , and resume text orders .
with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . first check the text that is to be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; html ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text that is to be read , and select Tools in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system ; noti@@ fies you about events you specify . you can also read &amp; extract the text of these messages .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for string composition provide a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ats ; incorrect st@@ ressing or incorrect messages to correct . the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file is a good example . it removes tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; quot ; . for normal work with &amp; ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to speech speech pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filtering works , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the screen reader is read , the sub@@ du@@ ed orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these jobs will resume after the issue of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are reading a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; greet someone who is entering the room .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one reads this , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string replacement plac@@ er replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre @-@ defined string translation filters , which enable the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ats ; some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contain in SS@@ ml .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the cartridge chart , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are sent , it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
for setting up character chain filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . case @-@ sensitive is not considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in correspondence with the string from the column Er@@ ase . the list is executed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will receive the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID indicates copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the string qu@@ etting filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character chain replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to connect these expressions . read the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package ger@@ min@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former Trans@@ form &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such forming . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible from the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the dial@@ up selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before writing a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker attributes that the program dict@@ ates , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sends , and the features of the speaker configured on the tab . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in typing .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which best meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ats ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ten@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . first start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other window .
no one of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do that by yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the PA@@ TH environment variable .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors to syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be rec@@ tified by a character chain replacement filter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend it , please contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ml and XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ cher &apos; program .
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ats ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ contex@@ ts or download the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using the speech syn@@ thesizer , first check if speech @-@ disp@@ cher is working properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the device by speech @-@ disp@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return pun@@ ctu@@ ation or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add to add a nar@@ rator to the list , or click Edit , the Kar@@ p@@ chart maker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . you will find details on the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in general , the setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slider lets you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some knob and display this gray , the voice selected will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker yet ( or to click Apply to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed when starting to t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon kt@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in the queue , together with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the ID number corresponds to the ID column ID on the card holder .
with buttons in this series you can proceed or return on the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of kt@@ ats , please visit .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ats ; either compiled or t@@ apped without support for the corresponding audio module ; it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you will need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ml ; % about the double normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to figure out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
on this tab , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message .
the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the screen reader , the sub@@ du@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these jobs will resume after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that fails to pron@@ ounce news . if you have just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is just entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , it will insert the audio output into the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions when these are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to check with &amp; kt@@ ats ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start t@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card Noti@@ fications will appear .
check this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; Un@@ lock Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are not read by default .
use these buttons to add or delete events . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .

&quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should do ; when an event occurs , you have the following choices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card holder as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is set for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .

use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all al@@ erts will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ats ; s@@ sh only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 . % , the SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . thus , you can start reading faster with pre @-@ reading since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set limits fi lter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ats ; a set limit detection filter is set up automatically as default . you can change its settings or add other set @-@ limit filters , beginners will be dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the language selection by trying out . switch off the language selection and enter text to read . switch the language selection again , change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel assignments on the tab card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is set up automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ating and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) . note that the default set limit filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the issue of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can over@@ ride the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings for the application on the Char@@ tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker selection &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card holder ) . in other words : there will be no speaker properties .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a subscri@@ ber subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; t@@ ort ; this speaker . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ats ; the speaker that is most likely to comply with the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything .
select this box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also place multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the displayed in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of speakers , which is best to delete the following , click on the Standard Driver and then use Spe@@ akers , which is the most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .

on the audio card there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found over the PA@@ TH environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the kar@@ mic card for speaker setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml converter filter , and set up the speech speed .

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ freely according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure options column shows the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you will have to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example

before you start using it , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software at festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you will need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so check out the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; produces audio output from it . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice sharing system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics di@@ phone .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code will be added to festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the Fol@@ der festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . it is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first you install the Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the re@@ compile of the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to spend the language on festival with Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PA@@ TH .

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume nor speech speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ats ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; on the command line .
best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create for the user a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers will be installed and installed for network hardware and other devices when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module &apos;s network settings start , it attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . selecting non @-@ recurring requests can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Network Interface Panel :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog device can be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the choice of Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the field of the net@@ mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking Interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the name resolution system allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in the list by selecting an application and listing or gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ dered or Her@@ under .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group machine to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group host to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit Pan@@ e dialog will appear .
the list of publicly known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of publicly known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... Add New alias dialog will appear .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple ali@@ ases names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... Edit &apos; Edit &apos; dialog will appear .
it can perform one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the static hosts list .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution may be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second part all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge on IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is given .
IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in external networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can &apos;t be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section there are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if in case of active DSL connections , another content is found to be specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by the scrip@@ ting in the Su@@ SE config file . another state than expected can therefore occur .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; -@@ dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; use the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ forming &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which in addition offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective extrac@@ ting .
before a tape can be used it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ covers the band and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape does not , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
if you can &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll be asked if the band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was connected . in the status bar there is a corresponding message . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a notification via a change of the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape drive must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not conform to the format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives however do not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape will be lost ! after the format@@ ting process is complete , the tape will be automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select the Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the backup settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Backup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears Rest@@ ore . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re@@ compile the band inde@@ x@@ .@@ This process will delete all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ compile the index on two types of tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a security profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder . folders belonging to other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , tran@@ sm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is incorporated the command takes the load to the drive . on some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting will not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when loos@@ ing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat it is automatically ej@@ ected ; do not use this option with flo@@ ppy stru@@ t .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only have one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the band was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users have quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stored the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , trying to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate protocol data from certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead a small message window , you will probably not have a system manager right . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion , or after entered strings . the list of the log lines will now be modified automatically , so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than minutes of level note . the color representation of protocol rows can be disabled settings dialog .
if you want to show only a certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the to jump to new lines in the main window context menu , in order to show all new protocol rows added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to start when starting the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel looks in@@ it in different places and starts the first one it finds .
the standard running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can fix it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument running .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new section . in order to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting number of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it by cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ er and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
in the LI@@ LO prompt , type lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save In the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user group list . to edit select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space limitations ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings .
the password management card appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card appears only if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( identi@@ fiable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation .
the tab group provides information about the group per@@ missions of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , check this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
