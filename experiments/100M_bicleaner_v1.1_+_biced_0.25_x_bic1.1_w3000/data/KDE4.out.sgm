<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish-side itself, where you can insert texts to translate them directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; load settings, select Settings... Open the tab toolboxes and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard instruction modules from the kde; addons package. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>

<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root tip of the document, example: documentitem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Special feature of & FSView; consists of plotting nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can either represent depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby representation errors occur due to limitations in the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can define the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting entries of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The implementation is left up to the implementation of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries. for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames, it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item View Adding in Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the picture gallery in the & konqueror; menu under Extras gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu item to the & konqueror; in addition, by which you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that decline access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and edit your photos directly in & editing; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing skills can be easily extended with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & editing; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; on camera or lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also digicode; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; When you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& nbsp; & nbsp; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam. if you are a regular user of & digikam, join. you can answer here questions to other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & edit is to sign up in the developer mailing list. instructions for announcing in the developer mailing list of & editing;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & editing; for the first time, you'll be asked where to store your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. simply enter path names or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data query is saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & nbsp; You will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the topmost folder that contains pictures as a base folder. no picture will be changed. no picture will be changed. while browsing the folder, you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicode; search recursively the library path in its entirety. you can't exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden folder. this can be done with extra-necks & editing; do this by inserting a point in front of the folder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can configure your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can also handle it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help RohcameraSupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and edit your photos directly in & editing; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digital cameras also support the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port is slow, this connection is in the meantime obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support for reliable reading of the preview images. the Exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may be able to see thumbnails or the generation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do & editing is how easy it can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Module: the KDE Image plugin Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & editing;, KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & editing; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came in & editing; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture can't be put in keywords, date list, or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so filtering on the filename only works when this is also shown in the toolview. which fields are displayed can be configured in the Albar Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistigt; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that are stored by & editing are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have a scanner set up, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Importing pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album Importing Screen Picture.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the pop-up menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to give information about this collection. to access the album features, right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collection: are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or sort albums After collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & nbsp; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistigt; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might then want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& nbsp; & nbsp; supports the entry of keyword for individual photos in the area My keywords list left in the main window. album collections have a different effect. to the collection are always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images will be displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a bit while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information is this can be edited by editing; Setting up. select the Albums page here and customize the preview pictures to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse cursor at a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all editing & editing. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can select all the features that have been editing & editing. you can choose between viewing the images, slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image editing... or selecting the right mouse button and selecting Edit... menu. in the editing pane, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. you can view and edit your photos with image editing.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & editing; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, find information in & bin; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image processing programs, it may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data with the same time you save the modified image. this will lose this information from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& nbsp; & editing; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right click on the preview and select rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">When you delete a photo from & editing, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del Falls if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">"" "the View & quot; My data limit" "" "; organize your photos based on the data." "" "either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last change of the file." ""</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the Date View, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tag photos provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by doing so, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keywords, 'so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. additionally, the keywords are re-imported as soon as the digicode is lost; the images will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keywords; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will be the subsample of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword using the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking it and selecting keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also right click on the preview of the images and select Keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the menu item menu. the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent, adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box that indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">You can enter a title in the field below and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>

<seg id="132">& digitization; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & nbsp; finds the appropriate pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move or zooming in or out with the mouse wheel. move Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this implies, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">You can add a name for your geo filter in the field below. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicode; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminous table from the context menu. the selection is added to the luminous table and its window. if you are back in & editing; main window are, you can quickly open the lumintable with L-Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you can select Preview from the toolbar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the pictures, you will also compare the same area of both images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a series of images. if you use combination-wise to navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the area for reloading. now use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it on the left. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminous table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it possible, for example, to link visual differences with exposure information.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section, you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to change the visible area of the picture, you must click and hold the & LMB. in the preview mode both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works exactly the same way as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the pictures or ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are offset in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos takes records, scans or digitally stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure, protect, protect and use your pictures. we focus on the process for digital photographers that & editing; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, optimizing, filing, storing, optimizing, waiting and export image files.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no inventory management to find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digicode;. the approach to saving the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is building up information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% are archives and 5% working files and you will not want to re-organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata; to activate it. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which one? to do so & editing; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you frequently call in other programs, or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & editing; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. resorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & editing; updated as the sub-trees are tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlapped. this is a very crude representation, because each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">Wow! you start dreaming, having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a lettering for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & editing; you can store as much text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8). you can also put it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even exports you a spell checker. if you export your images to web galleries, you will not have to tell the story a second time for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already at light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are already innumerable and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels with geographic information. this then shows the photos at the recording location.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a play of copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & editing; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): linked to the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture. this is very important for private individuals.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & nbsp; It will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, asterism diffraction, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. this section concerns problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must be handled carefully and you can't wait longer than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the checksums. despite this massive protective they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also read the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failover of hard drives for this topic: floppy failure</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART may indicate the imminent failure. these are particularly read errors and shift counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data due to a power loss before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter much, this is different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause bruised keyboards, complete data loss, hardware obsolescence, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable result that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip. remember, however, that not every connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, be sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers also provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coax cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks, so they are very small and you also have the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to continue working until the current is running again. if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security during power disruptions with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & Dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data protection, the web solutions are very secure. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically corrected and included with the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed storage system.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file systems ensure at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undetected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. for notebooks, the percentage of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been spotted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology continues to develop, there is a natural border for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather impaired. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, save your data after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous like installing your operating system, changing disks or changing the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Thus disaster prevention always means a not local storage. bring your backups upstairs to the neighbour house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: that of the complete backup and the last difference security.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, associated XMP files, Keep original memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available to anyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & Dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & Dollars; Parted resize / dev / sdc / dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your images in this format.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now provide DNG and we hope that Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blockquote; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP adjusts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a more complex editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again, edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were then cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in web galleries, encode to MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The Camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & editing. in the Adding a Photos to an album, you will be able to add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing pictures to your source database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera & digicam; use it, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras, it may take a while. some cameras do not display preview images. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for any file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file features and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as the meta-meta toolbar from the main window of & editing; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from all. this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in & editing;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button Selected will be grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been downloaded by & editing yet. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you are using the buttons All or download Selected, a dialog appears in which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & editing; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at a time by deleting the Delete All. if you want to delete only a few, you must first select them and then delete the selected deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be deleted in the trash bin of & kde; they will be deleted completely before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera cher, you should do so using the camera, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are normally reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames if you upload photos of different recording series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the picture was made in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this last option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer, three other options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data on the author in the Standard AutoriIdentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, in the edit field you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% H% H:% M:% S.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera filename option, you will have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters when downloading. or in capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & editing; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your rename settings are saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; Can you use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, it lets & digices; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Extension button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & editing; this is used to automatically create subalbums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date will be added to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, it stores & editing; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced option and select the Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the File selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & editing; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted by your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determination of the data can be carried out by the US GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with one click, which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & editing, users want to document the location of the photos, or simply document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the relevant IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be names such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as these are the picture to others & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">IPTC actions save the data to the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited & edited without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the images. this way, your lettering can also be read by other image viewers.</seg>

<seg id="293">These settings can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the luminescent, these settings are turned on when possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this view mode with F10 and F11 can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling this means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time to pack and unpack. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value on a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Compress the TIFF images with the TIFF file. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the deposition algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy settings, the relationship between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & editing; image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at present, it quickly becomes a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option distinguishes the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard, it is a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is to capture the pointed candles, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed candles. use the setting through white in the settings. the setting colors will create some unusual results, as they will attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general don't saturate as fast as green and red. & editing; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you will get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your liking. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing & editing image options. to keep the time for the Demosageddon small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosageddon algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; & editing; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks so. as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was used for me and the paper used by me. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction since you are carried out during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return them. there is also LCMS and & editing; information how to translate color information from one color space to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>

<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; Standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colourfully managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon that do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. at present, dcraw Gamma isn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile which allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Expansion sets the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & editing; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. none of the functions, however, will change the original photo before using file Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You may need to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can do this with File Storage.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore File menu or the Restore button Restore button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any image processing action can be undone or recovered. the last action can be reversed by selecting undo or Restoring by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this frequently, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and reconnect Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB file a moment longer via the return or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu File. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you are using the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change this in the editing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire image pages can be printet from your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print job from the Edit Audio menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Editing & editing; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the annotation view, you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are re-formed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sortations. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the urgency IPTC field. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the Keyword tree, and a chooser box with the keywords used previously in this & editing; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification in the input of keywords in a series of pictures. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by checking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are keyword stored in the keyword field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the Keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a sample with a keyword, please read the Keyword Fill section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and searches. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and store keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right-word tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options will then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. additionally, links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow complies with all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image output is by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB's limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sticker my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to calibrate your monitor, as sRGB indicates that your; onitor is brightened on sRGB. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you either need to sticker your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. so use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, adjust, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Conducting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values across the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same way: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity can be as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new acoustic of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & editing; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited there is a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can move too far from the original image areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode, which works in 16 bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right there is a histogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result displayed in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Store buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will create another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computational time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be carried through the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">& nbsp; The color effects tool provides you with four color effects, a solar-animation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that was created when printing a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. this was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar cell. at about 50% of intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Veloaquire; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color tracts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool tone-value correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application explained here. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected range. under the graph, three slides are clicked into and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the regulator and to take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, you can look at the original and preview the image. the preview will be updated dynamic, based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively modify the output values as in the input values. compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a bleached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and reload later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, remedies and sun sounds. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images captured using a digital camera, linear mode is the most sensual. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and the image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marker is visible. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipette buttons, you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sunny tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you find overexposed pixels in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sunny notes were set using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & editing channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve colour channels or change color shades.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right bottom: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, because the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when mixing monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colorless consists of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used for this purpose. you can save any mixer setting for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction ability. with the development of digital photography, black and white is a working step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to 002 Cokin (tm) orange filters.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of day. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color shade correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithelia: produces warm light and medium sounds while adding a bit of cold into the shade tree. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and the re-development in a squiatonic. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) scabafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & editing tool; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth resp. three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to be seen. the relief measures have been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & editing; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the confines of a photograph is not an easy task. one possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frames the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. passing through the image with a colored line, Niepce bordered it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), it is bordered with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoning effect and decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio earlier.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any position. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & editing; use tool templates you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Picture Schablone menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & edit, send an email in English to & nbsp; mailing list digicode-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your templates folder with the base folder in the dialog. here, select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears, reflecting the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the preview toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons that allow you to change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button is scaled down the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you will need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& nbsp; & nbsp; has three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to look sharper. in fact, it sharpens a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it does a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process needs to combine colours with minimal differences to a color point. elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically need more after sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a field of focus during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the Follow Advertising module. you can call this with the Conducting Follow menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for soft sign with the Conducting Soft drawing and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove eils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and thumbnail help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges are generated.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image being added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, one can define a minimum difference to be used for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore, beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the invisible masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurry masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & editing; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted decoding-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocusing mostly achieves better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folds are much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pixeles, which are far from the original source pixels. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is affected very strongly from the distant pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folds. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation decreases the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is aggressive. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular acuity or the Gauß's sharpness. however, be aware that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set is saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform any cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by making the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masks always have to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filters, it is always at least as good as the blurring mask.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture was taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing knob accentuates the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupillary.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinted ink permits an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothing over the image. whereas larger values can be smoothed in homogeneous regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional conditional alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes even in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD's, a high value will produce shaftlike patterns. JPEG Artifacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should make this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. every setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. hence, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture errors with little artefacts. the module is applied on a photo taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is an odd black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & editing; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular hum that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details of the subwindow and the Advanced settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bluff the image. the area specified by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter to the front to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, you may need to adjust the edges filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the Adaptive Filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubricate resumes again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot remove all noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maxim if you want to remove a weak splash or jpeg-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance level of the image. we advise you to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter range reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter will appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied to default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use the tool for soft sign with the Conducting Soft drawing and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicode; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß 'noise, film baskets, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The texture replacement is carried out using a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "the" "" "Save" "" "and" "" "Save" "" "buttons make it exactly this way. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and reloaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise will be reduced.. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & nbsp; tool Hotpixel allows the pixel animation of photos taken with a CCD camera gem, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality rough-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels" "" "and" "" "quot; bright pixel" "" "on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and thumbnail help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then, select the best filter method to interpolate those pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & editing; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1,5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which may possibly increase the necessary shutter speed, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise lack of sharpness caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges of today's film and color or grey level depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a picture without this filter. the tool is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vigilance correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2,0, which is equivalent to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly to a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image using the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer recalibration of the exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & editing; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vigilance correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a light and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicode; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flatly edges on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grader corrects the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion of the second degree of distortion. with negative values, distortion causes can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth gradient. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner parameters' has the inverted accidentals of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value rescales the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview around the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tony / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the cutting tool in the Transform Contrimming from image editing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film from the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below previewing you can adjust two parameters of film and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Füge movie grain if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sharpshooters.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicode; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can be calibrated with the sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicode; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & nbsp; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicode; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbonizze. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicode; filter Gravur shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & editing; Filters engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondared landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equal to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelenges 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="614">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blur: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness sharpness: blurred the image by randomly shifting the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photograph in rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling it with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshys protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & editing; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can fix it by mirroring or turning it into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the Transforming Turning and Transforming Spider menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo capturing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you re-locate or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the size of the tool using a linear interpolation method to close the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow it up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge an image. & nbsp;; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo was blown off by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbber effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stallotation for photo can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo blown by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not just a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to trim a photo you just have to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be grayed out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save file or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">When cutting the aspect ratio, you can indicate the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool In aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly aid make it possible to show help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third principle, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles towards the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational figure 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spirals. it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that as opposed to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equaled triangles. diagonal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you take a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & editing; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with slider corners. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transforming cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is to cut the function Automatically. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option leaves the picture a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point to the reference point so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is shifted slightly. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shoring tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">Select your image by using the horizontal and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point like e.g. the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After the scaling is done, the picture gets blurred a bit. for a single shooter this effect is usually negligible, but two cancellations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the picture has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& editing; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats will therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & nbsp; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you would like to learn more about the raw image format, you can read in English by Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images into JPEG or TIFF with the blank screen converter.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft sign, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; texture applicable; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame for selecting the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Features: shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move or zooming in or out with the mouse wheel. move Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this implies, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Palettes files that are installed by & kde may apply to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are located in your Personal Folder for & k; Settings and Hot Custom Color and Recently used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Palette dialog, you can select from a list of installed pallets, or browse folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the palette view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box is checked at the Beim Cursor button below the button color, the color is inserted from the colour plate at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the overwrite mode has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying, cutting and pasting.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a newline character, if another color follows. if there are three numbers in the clipboard, they can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selections can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphicviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are based on the program author's view and X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgrapher; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well-integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgrapher; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphene. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & calliviewers; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; at. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Placed; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & ates; recomputes the graph and in & calliviewers; displays)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate, or to open the graph in & kalliviewers; to open in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgrapher; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for representation of graphs. required are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & kalliviewers; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can choose from the context menu a fixed position of this overview, or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with press & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has been changed from another program just in & kwercase, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can also make use of the settings menu item kalliviewers; set up... use it, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of a running & clowviewer; open, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kgraphic viewer; to open the instance or display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both save and later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether parts of the graph that come to one page should be adapted to this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a row distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable loading page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">Opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kalliviewers; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that every time requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page provides the ability to specify the starting behaviour of & kalliviewers; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the last session files) or specify to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphical; -layout algorithms. the entries as described on the page of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of targeted graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphene. it produces images according to the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm created for ungerized graphene a springboard model layout. it uses the Fruchterman Reingold heuristics, and contains a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should display the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms specifying options, or also modifying the graph with a filter before drawing.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (judged or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type (dot; for directed, & neato; for uncoated graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the mouse cursor. with this mouse cursor, click on a & GUI; element to obtain further help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgrapher; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools for representation. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kalliviewers; use the Settings menu to find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the Symbol Editors is divided into five sections: the Main toolbar, the Toolbar for drawing tools, the status bar, the color palette and the grid where you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new icon. if the current file has been changed, you'll be asked if you want to save the changes. after that, a dialog appears in which you can choose if the icon should be created from a template, or whether you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Restores the last one-back step. if you have not made a step backwards, this function is disabled.</seg>

<seg id="767">The status bar displays the current actions. from left to right, it displays the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current canvas, the magnification factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="768">Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="769">Open with Settings & kiconSoftware; set up... a dialog with the three sides templates for symbols, background and symbol grid.</seg>
<seg id="770">With buttons Add..., Edit... and Remove, you can modify the templates for standard File, Source File, Compressed File & Etc.</seg>
<seg id="771">Select Transparent pixels or display rulers and set a color: or a chessboard as a transparency display. you can also adjust the size for the chessboard: the caros for small, medium and large as well as the color 1: and color 2: choose.</seg>
<seg id="772">The KIPI module reads images and provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this to work you must have installed Kooka and Sane.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu entry images, a dialog appears, which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. here, select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">Then the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducer's default setting to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen snapshots can be created after selecting the Importing &gt; Screen Picture... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen fotomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screenshot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been taken, the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="795">If you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to show photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera's online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Exporter to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentification, so it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is launched to allow you to log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send photos to Flickr homepage. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed on Yes, you will get the dialog for upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button pictures should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as tags during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Publish, Friends and Famillie, you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before the upload, the photos will be changed before upload in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to set the maximum amount of images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Galerie-Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery-export has no documentation at present. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographic location KIPI module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the image's EXIF keyword and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic location module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsyou can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the dialog shown above appears then. to get a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which shows coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation setting gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera zone. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">Interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data. if you know that a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually using this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the appropriate region and zoom sie.Add this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftp to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in an HTML page gallery to version 4.01. you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the Rider selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will appear the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, eg. Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. to do this, select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTML5, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other Color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the programs to determine if errors occurred during the generation. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG video encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG-Slideshow. then you can start creating the module via extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the pictures or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file by name of the MPEG output file. keep as much as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your needs, you can start the creation of the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG feature has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them further, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the option to automatically overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starcode and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. for this purpose, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. add more images via the pictures button. for the last image selected, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the pictures button, remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not take too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the pictures into a text file and the mail is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG below image file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors. your e-mail program will, however, be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with questions like your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL Transfer option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option to show filenames ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Ribbon option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually stop using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">Selecting images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used in the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the temporal gap between the pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly select a different effect during each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and start the presentation again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in each group, so in persons, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry people, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons can be seen will be shown. this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view images of your area of work.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button located on the right-hand side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, decide which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you need to open the picture view window (described in more detail) and select the category editor in the context menu. in the View window, you can customize the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can customize the image for the respective person.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the Find entry in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the lettering or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e. for example 1971, or the full date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures depicting Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, in case you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time or select the menu item kphotoalbum; -Demo. after that, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this strip you can see here:. as the name says, this line shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then shows a different unit. you can switch between units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The Timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview section) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & k photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas: content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description to contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & k photoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page. you will find useful information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can set how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear why this is not specifically discussed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 no longer download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, correctly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all been related to base-folders and URLs. a subfolder will be created in these settings, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to share your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a great deal of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in twofold mode. first, it searches through the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures is described, which you can access via the Export... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual copy option close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & k photoalbum to the Automatically near the .kim file; the images are automatically copied to you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want this anyway, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum picture size. if you send your friends images, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Importing... menu, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Importer for Importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your pictures, through (2) browsing and watching, to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are stored and used it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, which allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up whole member groups, i.e., all members of a group at one time in a group, instead of explaining all groups of an intermediary as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digicode and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own images.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI together are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply fits to the current view, so all the images that show you the image preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then every entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; do so, so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do this, start the settings dialog and select modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to every other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain much information as you have not yet received any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to add comments to each picture. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc., for example, you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box, you can set people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can, therefore, that the names used are moved up to find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are under the thumbnail of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multilingual entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window displaying the United States as a supergroup. to show you that this is a subgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a subcategory of this entry. attention, this implies that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that make the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simple clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Removing button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, use pictures without having you saved on the hard drive. of course you have to have saved the pictures somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary pictures can be uploaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into it. & kphotoalbum; so if you would like to avoid irritation like the mess of your images, please buy a larger disk in order to save all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who wish to make others inaccessible and click on "Current View" in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister is allowed to view and unlock everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to decide which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images, so that all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select your password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand all pictures on the hard drive and on the other can read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about an image _ and video viewer.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the image, but additional information you have to enter via the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box at the top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed. all of these options are available right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images uploaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image and the image of the buttons. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse. the Plus button zooms zoom into the middle of the image. shows how a zoom speck is selected and shows the zooms result.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the power button, zooms zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos do in and out zooming with the plus and MinuKey.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open the image configuration dialog to enter these names. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with characteristics, while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in that you press the corresponding letter. in this image you can see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, if you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add all the comments to you. this is described in the following. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview mode. if you can view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, & kphotoalbum allows you to paint on the picture.</seg>

<seg id="1011">In order to end the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation too & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subproperty of an object already selected, since all subitems are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then, you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subset item (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the Visibility level of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under an existing view, drag the Anfasser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to place multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the Anfasser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the chamfering bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfering bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... save it. a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written & Povray; 3.5 present. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The symbol renders in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render-mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the font size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the section of the subsection and enter the picture cutout into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality Combination field you can select the properties, which & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling is the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is again and again divided further and adaptively because the reclamation angle depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified pixels, then both pixels are processed by tracking an additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, R 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you switch on, change & Povray; the rays at a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection computes. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this tab, you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the related rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray player, select the Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the object's source code to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not located in the scene file, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of the dots to the grid in the context menu of the wire-model views. you can set the grid seperately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor is rendered beneath the objects. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window settings or create new window arrangements. in the window classifications section, you can explain how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The default window arrangement: displays all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at startup of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Custom window classifications list shows all existing window arrangements. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created by the Add button and selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window beneath the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. therewith you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click on the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change instantly according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insertion Endless body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to resolve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level, although at the moment only as a limited end level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the standard options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the horizontal as a unit, just in order to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can choose how to paste the object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the preview button see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course you can preview the pigments just a matte black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigmentation. so, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Always monochrome in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to perform this step simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler. the ball is just as easy to create as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: 1 (do not forget the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, since you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subproperty and change the name for example in ball pigments. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities are yours & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affecting. thus, the scene is processed pixel for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you watch the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is just black. obviously, every scene that needs to be rendered takes some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Reproduces the scene in the last saved version. all changes have been discarded since the last saved time.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you haven't saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new configuration or override an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based, by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can display with clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard to the & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialogue so that the user does not know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialogue --sorry' # {error} 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as base for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should include any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the default scripts of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is picked up. the script could now b & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected playlist files, if a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle will also be passed to enable the script to use dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which the user & zb may have downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compacted with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the generating amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can append it to www.kde-apps.org and the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; append. for your entry to kde-apps you should use the amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just want to find a very specific title out of thousands in your collection. with & amarok; s collection browser and quick search you'll find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you would like to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right one to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any difficulties in compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile-time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiler options, certain dependencies have to be fulfilled so that they can be used. details can be found in the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates Debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & amarok, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& amarok; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several learning flashcards for setting up the different functions of & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the playlist, the player window will turn on or off the player window. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use Voting Table: this function is only available when & amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. the option switches the experimental function of the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Make it more atmospheric: this function is only available if & amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. thus, the used color scheme for the mood barometer is changed.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Tuning files in the music files: this function is only available when & amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the preferences folder of & amarok; stored (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Make the current piece visible when changing pieces causes the playlist to open / down to keep the running track always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing part to the context-browser, the context-browser automatically displays the context-browser as soon as the next piece is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & amarok; Setting custom fonts, the otherwise grey section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist, player window and context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection activated among them for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback at startup causes & amarok; after program start, resume playing automatically with the piece on the spot with which it was stopped at the last exit.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The subwindow on-screen display enables you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the Shadow pane allows the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selections. if own colors do not use, the preset & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below, you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-screen environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output tab allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers still activate additional settings in this flashcard.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder you want to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively Browse subfolders: this causes & amarok; both the ticked as well as their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & amarok; all found playlists in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) add to your collection. the automatically added playlists appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setting is necessary in the MySql setup window.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & amarok; under machine: if the machine is located on which the MySql database is located. then under Port: the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use user name: and password: to enter the data needed for the connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card supports the support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations concerning the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows & amarok; to convey the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">To retrieve similar sounds: after activating this setting, & amarok; a list with similar interprets to the played piece. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including programs included in it, because & amarok; requires some to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide to minimise kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, assume that your window manager controls the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that taglib crashes when reading the meta-infos from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for it in & amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & amarok; compiled libraries with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this will lead to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable automatic. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email automatically opens when it comes to a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only appears an empty playlist. how do music pieces come into play there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the interface intuitive, the start sub-window was converted to the statistic window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the evaluation by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click & RMBn; click on the list box of the playlist and select column display. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] short commands. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, then press Def on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From Playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop them down, just as you would like to do with other files. as simple as that: -)</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously play audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software blender).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to provide another link (e.g. ossware).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does & amarok; already. don't forget that media first need to be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server operated with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">For KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you don't use the arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use any other driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less carriers respond to the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how to use all the functions of & amarok; including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display indicating the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can change through the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>

<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classical to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use the EQ button in the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you activate the Equalizer box, the equalizer will be in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of features deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side of the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right side is the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted using context-browser design. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they provide information about the current piece to each different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow launch has fallen away. the information shown there is now distributed to other parts of & amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information on the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context-browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "among the" "" "Recommended" "" "pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information to display in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on any of the pieces in each area to start playing right away. you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text below, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, you will be able to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the song text. the modified version will then be stored in & amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - In addition, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and further division is performed according to the respective album. if you want to see concoctions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection are listed alphabetically together. the artist is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically detect your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year. you can also select your entire collection, which makes the filter practically shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By right-clicking on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Loading - This records the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach the playlist to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Highlighting the compilation-mark - Change a album marked as compilation back into a normal album. after that, the album is no longer under different interprets, but again under the matching interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser is easy to use with many playlists. among other things, it also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists can also be created. simply click Smart Playlists to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & amarok; for example, your iPod with & amarok; to be able to use, for example, your iPod with & amarok; be included in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod as performer in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the performer list. when you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. when the transfer is complete, you exit & amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file-browser, there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a given URL. if you enter the tar: / home / mike / musictar.gz for example, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will insert caseless files automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping them. clicking on the playlist will show only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, then & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one in two, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) will be found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then complete the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example, rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, place a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR View: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a labeling with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add to the playlist. to the right, you'll find the playlist, empty playlist, and Random Mics.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will return and restore, so you can undo or restore any changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1473">This dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and trim black borders.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted media. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the disk or ejection of the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view also allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header line is a narrow section which is only visible if the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for modifying the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights will be required, therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the & k3b settings; general program settings can be made here. almost all functions of & k3b should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, therefore your taste and type of your task is more important than that of the provided programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; you must first make sure that & k3b; start. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMedia CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, QString) void renameItem (QString Path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to create a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trucker / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; it is an audio CD; it can easily be read audio CDs; it can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and supported by many encoders which encode these wav files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default.</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) compress in the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not installed yet, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggg (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welter Kodiers gives a small introduction to coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bang any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device handles the protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), it will be explained later by the daily use for reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work entirely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB file requests the CD data subject to the creation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the Settings-Settings tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it should be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the Settings dialog tab in the encoding settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, blank) for program events (such as read & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Creator opens the & kaudiocreator main direction dialogue; with different flashcards (such as encoders, to set up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important as both coders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is delivered with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo equipment. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset ultra' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the unit. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset ultra -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; add title to the keywords if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioguides; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; and in addition, the information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to be set up by freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used to do so; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the coding and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed by the applicable Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodiers is in the chapter Welsh Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, more information can be obtained from its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codec of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; to read out. check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure of what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found using a search engine, as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it (eg by trying to copy it into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what each read & CD must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the codec to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any time when reading a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information request, so that you will be informed when information is missing for creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Karsten Card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately begins reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work first.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as many firewalls default the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the 8080 protocol, since the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp file exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to discard the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not ticked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo equipment. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, it can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as default for each read of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; don't use it in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from those for a & CD; with successful from freedb deforested data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually input data instead of picking them out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example. it is a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, search for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully retrieved by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives, a window is displayed and you can select the database entry, which in your opinion is best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; Settings dialog for the Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the unit in the first line of the 'Now Title' input field, the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist must no longer be entered in the" "" "Current Title" "" "input field, unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Caution: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD Editor is not empty but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you will have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum. this option is set on the encoding settings section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. look at the help to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that matches the style of the read-only CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line will unlock or out the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All items on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a coefficient you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we've typed here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first play.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. this makes reading and coding parallel. note the status message in the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read out and code. with weak machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left corner of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD on the drive at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? if you are reading this, you probably have already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; it is intended to do so. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you succeeded in getting the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke game of & kde; besides others, it also has some properties that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, who is needed for GUS cards. alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -Window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid will automatically determine the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you exit & kde; end while playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file of a & konqueror; -window fall into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play pause from the menu or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces it is added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playing speed. in order to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when one piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the piece, interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is determined automatically, which uses a song so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played back in the series. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection under the item Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, it appears the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu option sequence of the Collections Collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song, the next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button PrePrevious piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI capability. in this case, MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and will always let a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary modifications for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the Keymap section, which may appear as often as requested. prerequisite for this is, however, that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality symbol is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument requires. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term 'drum patch', where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped to a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymap for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used above all to map tones to the percussion channel. take a look at the provided Keywords as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the Forcepatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Bender Ratio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives the keyboard that a pitch Bender event is supposed to play with the value 4096, a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need a little bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI Settings. you will find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force no one, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen when you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid, compiled without AWE support. to fix the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & code; Desktop 1 & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file). in this way, when the collection is finished or I want to play a file, just change into the & konqueror; drag the window and drag the desired file into & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have MIDI files A.M., B.A. and C.A.. first, you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.A.. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.A. and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I studied mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and proving propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid, written completely in my free time and won't get money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE tickets.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Mr. Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view pictures. you will also find links to pages with additional karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it works as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If you encounter problems, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files that are supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear when information is to be returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical student. when you click on an entry, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and the play begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. simply click on a name of a category, select it from the View menu and as next editing mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the Playlist menu must be selected using Playlist, selecting either the editing mode, or selecting another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processor is left or another group is selected without the same as the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / .x.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; img dur = "inv. src =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet, "; & lt; /;; In the package testing / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another feature for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in & KMPlayer's configuration dialog. everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there is no error here, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a given backend is always taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this is also determined), it must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should restore all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be detected. ports should be detected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the Video forlinux extension for the X server must be working properly. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsp., pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vob source.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clues on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when playing from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdpars -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as root after the device has been inserted. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom refers to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why must my CPU be checked for its performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauled. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1755">Code: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be selected (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for & latex; for the integration, they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Cover (DIN): the Documents of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always find use in the preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source-text editors - the emphasis on the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you want to see deeper areas of a green text on the screen, it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile, an empty line (for example\\ end {command}) will be created automatically when entering a new command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the Settings box; Setting... LaTeX commands disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most important and subcutaneous element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; file recovery may be very helpful. once a DVI; file is created, jumps & kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the native output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print out DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-up search, the elements of the DVI; file are plucked with the editor and as soon as an element is clicked in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is clipped to the corresponding point in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. a master document simplifies work with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "file monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file can be" "" "on-out" "" "and" "" "out" "" "and there is no call from & Okular; after quick construction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large boxes should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision include:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is for inserting articles such as keywords, grout notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary input. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & box; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ The e is used for defining the font. it can be set the fonts for the main text, the grounding notes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and determining the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] sets the character set. if the font is not fixed at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the button fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; removes the file automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document is missing, you should look for errors in the logging. if you use fast construction, you should automatically start & use eyepiece. if this is not the case, the logging should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the letter size e 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows the change of the fonts to be done within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be supervised in the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no restriction (number) for the changes in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold prints, italics, underscores, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with an\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">A step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows after the background is presented for writing the source text with the & latex;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. this should include a quote, a few passages in the bold and bold print and a poem to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (in the viewer) using File Print (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, simply set up the Modern under Settings box... Tools construction will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the preview, the mouse-pointer must be positioned in a row of the source text and then click on the preview. the jump to the appropriate spot in the DVI; -viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and applied to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; Set as Text Editor (Settings Okular... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should errors occur when using fast building of the & DVI; if there is an error, this will be summarized in the log file or message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file will indicate the source of the error in the source code. in the editor, the buttons Previous LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error can be used for jumps between the errors. to view the flawed line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document. more information about this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template by making an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if an easy way to create a template, you should search for a template on the Internet and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands which can be found in & latex, and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, when you click on\\ par\\\ par\\ par\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search the different types of source texts and to highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can create additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu items edit jump stamps or the corresponding push buttons make the jump to the next or last jump. this jump marker is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile; though & Posters; already excellent options, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is always supported & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & Kile; is that the slots are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also has an extended meaning, since this command also has a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Placards; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; that's why & Kile; for more commands in the Edit area for a common simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located in front of or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can be quickly lost. this command closes the last opened environment so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. in the Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit area.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current batch (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located in front of or behind the braided parenthesis of a & tex; -group #, it will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many welded groups clasps, the overview can be quickly lost. this command closes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple add-on signs are used as a tool. for the appropriate implementation is used in & box; the sign "is used for two simple indication signs. also for the end of the application, the character" is used.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double opt-in sign can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">"" "you can also use" "" "" "" "specific" "" "settings (e.g." "" "german or French" "" ") and therefore English or French" "" "German or French" "" "characters." ""</seg>
<seg id="1834">When holding shift; enter key & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close in a table environment, complete t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an enclosed line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under settings Kile; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to classify the columns in tables -surroundings and thereby all the Et characters (amp;) among themselves. at the bottom of Shift; Alt; ramp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the above line. although this tab is not the corresponding, add & Kile; add some space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offers a good source code completion, this has been added to & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;), three different modes are installed. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the back button is pressed, the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the completion list can be moved. on the other hand, the list can also be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are also removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump stamps can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing jumps and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Cle; Set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. you can select different types of works for & tex; - and & latex; -orders as well as native speakers of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for completing environments. it always has to be entered a few letters with\\ begin and the call of the execution mode will result in a large e list with ambient conditions. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing environments is available.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete operating environment or the Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically initialled to open the environment and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and finished by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. as soon as & box; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; Set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the full list of execution mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of cut-outs, which are immediately replaced by more expensive strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... The file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word veracity mode is initiated via the menu item Ctrl + Alt Location, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large e-mail users are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been found that many rights in a document are written more than once. thus & Kile; the complete compensation for all rights already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Settings box... Can be shut down. here also the threshold value for displaying the complete damage can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to review the basis for graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then be converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped groupwise into the menu creation, create conversion and create views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers such as & Okular; or the other transformation can be used the Alt-2 key; after that, the DVI; file is converted into a PS file by means of old; 4; 4 the DVI; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the fast build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will pop up each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the menue project New Project.... The following information is requested for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1864">A complete reindeer for & tex; and a full-bodied co-operation. this is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather a complete operating manual for the & latex; it is therefore ideal for searching for a particular formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textual; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / textual; the small application text doctk, which contains a database with all documents & kicks; delivered documents and here a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the increased advantage is searching for package names or key words. by & Kile; then only the results will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which are called & quantaplus; themselves possibly have little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and don't have to wait until someone uses the fake in & quantaplus. the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all included plugins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location & quantaplus, use this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on one project several persons work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (its identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for the information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Event Configuration of Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Remarks are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Enter comments is easy. it can be selected either the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by Notation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to an identifiable member of the team. in this case the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the specified nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject Manager.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including code completion may be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lower case of tags inserted. normal size / lowercase means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: when checked, tags for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish tag: when enabled, the corresponding final tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic set-up of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the identification of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting here will be stabbed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the chosen DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document from this backup can be restored during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the standard when the next start is useful when the user interface has been modified by modifying the MDI modes and / or appending views. it is equivalent to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of non-compliance.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location around the behavior of & VPL; to change. it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of node in the tree, the current frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting shortcuts (a kind of templates), which can be unfolded while editing text. abbreviations are grouped into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed by third-party plug-ins, which can be re-used by any KPart-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standar like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading component in the "Read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses the loading. only-Read-Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then testet & quantaplus; as to whether the entered information is correct. unselect allows to save the application even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely new. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the debugger's supported functions, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to the debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so you don't have to pay attention to it in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session Start the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the view debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is paused, the execution proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, whereby, if possible, it will be correctly adjusted in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Island as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; front-end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how to make you better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup- and scripting languages and & CSS. they allow & quantaplus, capabilities like code completion and Knotenbahn. their simplicity and flexibility make from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the day folder and the toolbars. tag folder includes two file types, the descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic toolbars of image buttons (above the editing window), which add text and instructions to a document faster than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writing fault.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of tag XML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all of them are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as one-element type over itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (Family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags describing how this attribute is supposed to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a merely item type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and need to be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but be careful & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. leaving this will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog on the top of the & quantaplus is to start and check TagXML. dialog. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not currently available. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD processing DTD settings. thus diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a simple & description.c; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = verse 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... and created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned shortcuts. clicking on the user defined button can be assigned to assign a shortcut; with Keiner, the current key symbol is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus; the script in the following locations tries: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for control of & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input from & quantaplus, to the default input. in the input field, you can specify what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected portion of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two kinds of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output drop output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable "Edit Day" dialog if available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Exit! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconSoftware; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size Item.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually marked as los, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, indicate a message to the user that clicking on this icon will paste; start; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar and set the toolbar to select the tool bar. make sure the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup to the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository whether someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations e.g. PHP; 4.2 Document Section 1 = section 2.html...</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the PHP documentation; documentation is something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; Folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space characters do nothing, but be careful & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcee files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the doc file which is used to design context-sensitive help. for example, if you want to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function by checking the function name and pressing of Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / var / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the discarded resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an email-send menu item, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus, users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team considers them as correct and useful for publication. to make an extra contribution, we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can fill in the input fields (URL Preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) from the DTEP menu, upload tool bar tool bar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, checks & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML language, which is currently not currently supported by & quantaplus, but it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be required. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Download and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dwarp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that should appear in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are a number of key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from quantaplus, you have to familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts first. this chapter seeks to familiarize them with these fundamental concepts without their understanding and quantaplus, little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, emoggling the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the tree view, the checkers with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, or open the file if the string below the cursor describes a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; insert into your document then click on the symbol that represents the day. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. should you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Architectures (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with multipliers stand for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool called & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the contextual menu then displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; field. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of spin-down in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, you can change attributes and namespaces. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download prepacked documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tab at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate section of toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus, as any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; to modify files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a nearby idea: what if & quantaplus, a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus, now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be & quantaplus, for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of why development what someone else has developed? thanks to & kde; scaffolding is not only this possible, but it allows users and developers to expand & quantaplus, as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible for almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help center help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on templates. if you attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, converts special characters to & html; scrolling, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; scrolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost, to paste & URL; s into the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">On and off of the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol columns to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webblaj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this enables, for example, to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in projectors / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">This creates a dialog to add a new toolbar. it only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... or they will be saved by tool tracks tool bars or you will be asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not deletes it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; It is useful if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu Standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day preferences dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent pasting means that & quantaplus, refusing tool bars when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the Posters; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is tab card mode, which is also the default setting, or subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Display the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in the context of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be selected using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webpage (e.g. foo.webcam). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate choice of coupon code.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of the files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or Shift-F7 key.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders are possible), which are readingently ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plug-in can be set with the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles can be set in the Profiles subwindow (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by shutting its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the Event Configuration menu, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens and quantaplus, the last project opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose Open Project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webcam as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder will behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is required and the rather insecure password on the disk Save option is not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers.</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a hazard. use it at your discretion. the password is hidden on the disk so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project toolbar menu or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus, to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are customisable; the best thing about the toolbar menu. use and add differ. adding tool bars will be treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the icons on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created; other actions can be executed like toolbar, rename tool bar or set tool bars, which can be specified, which actions should be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set Settings... set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates as a standard file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in roughly the limitations you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be binary any file except text, i.e. pictures, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents are nested in accordant subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, compiled in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template As a local template store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As presentation save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with dragging and dropping to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting via the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click on a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, the project folder will be backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / var / var / share / apps / Quanta / var / Quanta / templates. each of these folders equals one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once elterial attributes have been acquired.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template list. if a root folder would be set in such a way, it would disable templates in this path unless explicitly enabled. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or added text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copy of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source text editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second tells the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back if necessary to the source editor, in which the implemented changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document, which & PHP; includes, a small green symbol indicates the VPL image of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, the key pressure changes the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization by one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, for example, keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keywords keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Cursors may be used as in word processing, moving with arrows. in rare circumstances, the cursor behaves odd. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and dropped by button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as the toolbars, such as the source text editor. it must be noted that the inserting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparison. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many points. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no hint at the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in the automatic selection of the correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder consolidation:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check the code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed prominently. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make typing work easier by executing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 Folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 Folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual typing of filenames, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is ticked, the input field for the target is active and can be processed. however, it is not essential to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button will open a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to pull text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains, for example, several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, them in & kdiff3; then load them and compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare them.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract from & kdiff3; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source file contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file does not have lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons for the next solved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this also causes a jump of the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merging or manual editing, no more line remains in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the row. this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet another source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; crash conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the options, Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, siv as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the input window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Contacts section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-image upside / Ctrl-image downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, you automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is dropped. be careful with this option because you could accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep track of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved when you exit and restored at the next start. (menu Configuration - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays font with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered straight away. on these systems the button presets automatically create an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the previous line indentation will be automatically applied to the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a cart return sign '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others will only look identical to a newline '\'. if this option is checked, you will be able to use different sizes in the page-to-side comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before continuing to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already one such backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Modify the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to quit & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is globally disconnected via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for the encoding, a short note appears, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; & lt; & lt; C or B & lt; -; C will be displayed next to the normal one, a second overview column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. up-to-date file merges in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which exactly matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor which matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line offset to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression of all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first string.\\' converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line deviations. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several repairs at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are kept for viewing and merging. further operations only change the data that the line ablation algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that modifies text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and, in the worst case, destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... carries selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that time will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder, & kdiff3 shows; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or double-click the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As you can see in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option directories are synchronized, then & kdiff3; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and storing the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible filenames for the output file; copy & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option of selecting New file rather than merging (unsafe) is checked, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not fixed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is executed after the other. you status column displays finished when merging is successful, and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happened. when merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all join actions (also in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you haven't specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder-merge Mode C is used as a target, in the two-folder consolidation, B is selected as the target and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all the entries, select Start / Continue in the menu or press F7 (the key symbol). to bring only the current item, select Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When nonconflicting file types still exist invalid coherence actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file) then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select start / resume folder consolidation or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; your work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you crash on a fault, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before continuing together.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will not see any entries (in the current session) and do not merge them again at a later date. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory linkage with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter several patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid place holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid place holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a previous dot marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated as normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not containing possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link would lead to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders across a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Confidential the Date Modified. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this may be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are later identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the later file is suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of single files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the Folder merge view will remain visible to the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can split the directory & text window into the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text windows.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You may also prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu. you can also merge a single file directly, without first having to merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost though, if you re-read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # uses the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date differ from the original. (note the Option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first and foremost the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select Inde3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; assume that the file is a patch file in the unified format. then, & kdiff3; the patch program starts & kdiff3; the patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select "Preview" from the Context Menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file is created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as a part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing files is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist it complies). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long ago and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiffui.rc).</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character differs, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far been too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; -mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update feature.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed showing differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C lettering under the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, finish them or shift them. this works both within a desktop as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries Pager set up... and Beams. if, however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, Desktop and Bee. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Clicking on this field allows the & Kpager to indicate the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is crossed with name, the names will be given with ordinal numbers, eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here you can specify the order of the & Kpager; classically let & Kpager; appear in a 2xN grid, such as pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual worktops are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their content.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... let the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root, or log in to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the basic KDE packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kiss, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. below, this window is called magnifying window. the image that appears in the magnifying window is a magnified area of the screen and is described below as selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting & Cases; the area around the mouse cursor as a movable loupe. alternatively, you can indicate a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>

<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key, press or press the & MMB; you can shift the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated a mouseclick as soon as the mouse cursor freezes in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouseclick is causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer should also be caused by pain. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic relief items, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you stop the motion short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button executes. in this way, you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button. this way you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; executes a mouse-click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting-shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button, before releasing the mouse button, when no moving of the mouse is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, creates a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and click here the General tab. there is a slimbar sound buffer that you can set at a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at every start of & kde; start. this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset after the last push of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in tune with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware at which points a mouseclick remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not provide a link does not result in unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in a different location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor in where you want it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of the mouse and eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark this way text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move when you just start using kmousetool; instead, select text instead: execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and holding the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when intelligent moving the move time begins. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible click of the mouse. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">Um & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and these are correctly set up.</seg>

<seg id="2631">String replacement placer replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is supplied with pre-defined string translation filters, which enable the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformat messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of supply of & ktats; some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contain in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktats; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the cartridge chart, you can read the text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notifications are sent, it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up character chain filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text. case-sensitive is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replaces it in correspondence with the string from the column Erase. the list is executed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions out of a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl; key pressed at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You will receive the application ID running programs with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, & qdbus; the application ID indicates copy-3432, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string quetting filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if match. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the character chain replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can use it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to connect these expressions. read the & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package germintils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer Transform & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such forming. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible from the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the dialup selection filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card holder, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before writing a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker attributes that the program dictates, which sends the text to & ktats; sends, and the features of the speaker configured on the tab. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in typing.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected, which best meets the desired requirements. click the button on the right to display the Speaker Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -forming filter, but when using the module for festival websites, websites are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone to enable Sable to work at all. you must do that by yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the PATH environment variable.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors to synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only gibberish is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure the character encoding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be rectified by a character chain replacement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the kdelibs and the development files for the 'speech-dispcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code of & ktats; from the source code archive for kdecontexts or download the tarball created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using the speech synthesizer, first check if speech-dispcher is working properly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, use the spd-conf shell script.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of kttmsgr. the program kttmsgr will be developed in such a way that the device by speech-dispcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limit filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single sentences. thus, you can start reading faster with pre-reading since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limits fi lter. at the first start of & ktats; a set limit detection filter is set up automatically as default. you can change its settings or add other set-limit filters, beginners will be deprecated.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the language selection by trying out. switch off the language selection and enter text to read. switch the language selection again, change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changes. of course, you need to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel assignments on the tab card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is set up automatically when you start tmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuating and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering). note that the default set limit filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (notify), warnings, messages or the issue of Screen Readers.</seg>

<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a subscriber subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & tort; this speaker. otherwise, & ktats; the speaker that is most likely to comply with the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this feature does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also place multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the displayed in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of speakers, which is best to delete the following, click on the Standard Driver and then use Speakers, which is the most likely to follow the following.</seg>

<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml converter filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener language synthesizer, written in & Java; i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can set neither pitch, volume nor speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktats; with any language synthesizer, which can be controlled in a & Console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and usage of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create for the user a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers will be installed and installed for network hardware and other devices when installing and installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module's network settings start, it attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. selecting non-recurring requests can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking the button. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the Network Interface Panel:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog device can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the choice of Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the field of the netmask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog will be shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on an off-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking Interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If more than one network interface is present on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the name resolution system allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be placed in the list by selecting an application and listing or grading in the list with the buttons Hindered or Herunder.</seg>
<seg id="2822">"" "by clicking the button" "" "Add..." "" "from the group machine to the name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog." ""</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group host to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. the Edit Pane dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of publicly known hosts describes hostname-to-IP address links for TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of publicly known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still in the test should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known host and click Add.... Add New alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has multiple aliases names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... Edit 'Edit' dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can perform one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the static hosts list.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, the command must be set in a & Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient, if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphic interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution may be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second part all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge on IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is given.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in external networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can't be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section there are the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if in case of active DSL connections, another content is found to be specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is reassorted by the scripting in the SuSE config file. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which in addition offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective extracting.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; recovers the band and reads the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognizes & kdat; the preload on the tape does not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If you can't find it, you'll be asked if the bandindex is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was connected. in the status bar there is a corresponding message. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a notification via a change of the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape drive must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not conform to the formatting in & kdat. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape. floppy tape drives usually do not require formatting of tape, DAT drives however do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and the capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape will be lost! after the formatting process is complete, the tape will be automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select the Save...</seg>

<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick in one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears to check. this dialog displays the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before initiating the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears Restore. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recompile the band index.This process will delete all existing index files for this tape. you can recompile the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a security profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder. folders belonging to other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & quot; & lt; & lt; lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is incorporated the command takes the load to the drive. on some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting will not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when loosing the integration of & kdat it is automatically ejected; do not use this option with floppy strut.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to tell & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only have one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the complete name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open. if you don't see it, and it opens instead a small message window, you will probably not have a system manager right. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion, or after entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be modified automatically, so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than minutes of level note. the color representation of protocol rows can be disabled settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the to jump to new lines in the main window context menu, in order to show all new protocol rows added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Click here for more up-to-date information about the source of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & k; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the & Linux; world. and because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to start when starting the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init in different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard running level is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument running.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevels to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new section. in order to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting number of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. pre-settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveler and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">In the LILO prompt, type linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user group list. to edit select the desired user or group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space limitations (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card appears only if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (identifiable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab group provides information about the group permissions of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, check this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
