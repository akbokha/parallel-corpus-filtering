although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , reading American authors and practi@@ sing his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only reinforced by my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and the racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ ry person ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
tr@@ umps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also agreed with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in play .
the s@@ ling@@ ing intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
still it fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much in my career .
these people and values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can candidate for presi@@ dency , she offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters themselves as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an in@@ capacity to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters who are most aware voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down contemp@@ t for those looking different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( meaning &quot; White vs. all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ) ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash play in white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means whi@@ pl@@ ash injuries ) , as the great Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for he chose this country as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ an , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a vast majority of white America ple@@ dges this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ r K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do African Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan completed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now Tr@@ ump &apos;s Land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by tr@@ ash
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave young people a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ay &apos;s capital - play instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop on musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ ophone , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ics follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters , before the other coast of Africa was sought .
the East African countries were so upset about this and reluct@@ ant to welcome a criminal of this kind to their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia due to lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network , alongside Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that drove the prime minister from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and support each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden , which is why it is extremely difficult to track down . this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions are now in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas . also , susp@@ icious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . this means that ships cannot sell their cargo and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to regain rep@@ uted 20 million USD in lost sales , which lost the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishing that inv@@ ades East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world , including illegal fishing .
their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of imag@@ inary names , fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 suspici@@ ons of susp@@ icious ships .
it revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escape ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that is what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO focusing on fishing data and providing technical support .
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system that connects different information levels . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally operating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Reserve Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be used to display the position of each trac@@ table ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what where - it just makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to uni@@ fy and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also sc@@ aring them off .
ships that used to fish without a license , and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors arrived there on the tow@@ ing nets which were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there , in 2015 , six countries joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they now fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also entered into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is further escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moti@@ ons in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture by MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

when the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were in place , re@@ acted by meeting in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , among others in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition looked at the chance for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the dis@@ continuation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ working at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the rate of inflation and violence belong to the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment for many is considered the only way to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike at the next day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , should continue to block the referendum on the removal of the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all after Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most common shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that tell about quar@@ rels , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which shows the extent of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures have been forged .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment .
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from its point of view , has little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship have been investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secret .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not yet realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the 1974 @-@ 1983 Argent@@ inian military dictatorship , his father was deputy commander of intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor responsible for kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall .
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with an ERP .
don &apos;t Pass just that you don &apos;t have to kid@@ nap one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be al@@ right .
on the base of the military I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just anything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured , &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in which cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just anything - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked in and saw a lying woman being tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty no@@ od@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for someone to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore ey@@ eb@@ rows .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian accused also in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay face down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed cau@@ ti@@ ously on matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed a man there and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , said to the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Str@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came up that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y of war &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sequences that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but when you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , painting , money ... it is not a war spo@@ ils but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the chief of security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once upon a time he called me a criminal and I replied : and you , who sti@@ ck@@ les cars on the road ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill you in your own hands .
we don &apos;t need anyone else for that !
that is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but still brought home clothes .
at that time , the Defence accused me of having been a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied that no problem , they can give me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that I am older I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you have executed people during dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom they could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ established , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something is always there .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie , I was even myself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked myself why the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have been forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I &apos;m bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crime committed between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 defend@@ ants were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were sp@@ ells .
eleven out of 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which was founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or van@@ ished during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with translation error at a Kyoto centre where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a particularly un@@ successful translation in the last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word was transferred to the &quot; older car &quot; ; the &quot; older car &quot; means , er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously - perhaps also with bad back @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; hor@@ se@@ atic mot@@ orists &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edit the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could an English translation come about ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty english translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture has ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people were insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News explained a little more detail about the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , which are involved in accidents across the country , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased during the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the so @-@ called re@@ porter produced comments on the light which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How faulty is the translation at all , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
there are many reasons for the widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination of translation errors .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , nevertheless allow translations to be made internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is best estimated , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble and enig@@ matic sentences , which are caused by machine translation , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto , hopefully , uses a rep@@ utable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later on , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online trans@@ mit@@ ters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which oppose the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was gro@@ ping and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enables your VPN to be enabled .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are blocked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay offers are popular with Internet access from Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ in@@ fil@@ in@@ tro , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online trans@@ mit@@ ters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its meetings .
past research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , has shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ a as a child . she now visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ ans , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . used with kind permission of structural .
the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Fall Schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride speaking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ lla , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children do have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that in the framework of a contract that cannot be raised .
the practice designated as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ans is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know of it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households receives a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body was showing traces of violent strikes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the local registration office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved on a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an community for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows than children are registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to justice , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ breaking - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to justice .
the Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ a
the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exploited not only as labour @-@ workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik party , in which her father worked , had to en@@ rol in bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as a Cri@@ adi@@ a .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but never got unlimited food . &quot; I could fetch more books from the landlord &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from the opposition papers like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they felt that I would again learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and n@@ anni@@ es in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little friend for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , also out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the ad was switched off again : &quot; &quot; &quot;

bill blocks Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty @-@ six Egyptian MPs recently voted in favour of a draft bill on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or fin@@ es .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is going through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users from the telecommunications ministry received a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as well as they might be violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image space , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the Iraqi Kurdist@@ an Mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of the leop@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find always less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or .
the chance of seeing a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately pointing another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region are set up .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
for this purpose , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and survey results of those concerned themselves .
the residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ homes were completed ( in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these homes while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation establishments ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ash@@ et@@ su u@@ ut@@ ch@@ u &quot; ) must be res@@ ett@@ led to final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who stayed after the disaster in accommodation establishments , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were hit by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial re@@ building is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 per cent of the ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have resum@@ ed their operations .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land on a large scale .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 % destroyed cultivated farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear bar@@ rage zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants are experiencing it as more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population being prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies . she questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their sensitivity has changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
how to ev@@ acu@@ ate those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper increased their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , slightly more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
according to the state of 2017 , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they are known to bring them back to correct dwell@@ ings because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .

after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten by the police at nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva based on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march across the country .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated on this Saturday and now put it into an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be shown on TV for six months and the entire suppression would thus be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , where one sees Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided into social networks several times .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado invites other violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he under@@ took the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group joined , only to crimin@@ alise teachers , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him with a bat@@ on .
police re@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which brutal police operations came against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers deployed rubber shells and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters staged a stage for speakers .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers &quot; party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers nationwide .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to display illustr@@ atively their title pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a particular cause .
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages lost by the de@@ colon@@ isation of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are in operation because they were received .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene remember exactly that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane mill , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already opposed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality had better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ s &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the years that followed , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the location to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it consisted of officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
against his will , he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services they were generating in the communities in which they were present .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to slaughter them , they also stopped to pi@@ erce the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they were made to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the provision of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

the original workshops were led by teacher David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop aims to encourage young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street in West @-@ Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were drow@@ ned or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stop@@ per is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will rise
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way , they can grow and also advance our youth
so they can do what the Creator has destined to do .
in the commentary text , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the crop in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; round &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is right on the menu , they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin delic@@ ately ( all @-@ in @-@ the @-@ out , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ bo@@ b@@ ish district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a lot of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is now turning it into conspic@@ uous mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i released a series of social media links and photos which show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin purple .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone straps , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some sho@@ vels fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , a Kais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone stand .
also this part we produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple containing your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phones , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more bizarre plastic dishes you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 on Twitter for the time of the h@@ ash@@ tag .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed persons regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , completely pushed the stories of the victims of conflict to the background .
on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone find , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ pren@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( &quot; Living with the Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who are caught up in the battle between law enforcement authorities and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Times Edi@@ ted &quot; ) nar@@ rates these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who looks for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we asked ourselves to go and search for graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15 he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education .
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not receive it because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ pren@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensation @-@ journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me down .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin will think he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the non @-@ crime of the people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified with the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to conc@@ ede that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not move and are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family has been lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminals hired money from their business month after month , until they had destroyed not only the business , but also tore down their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will be kidn@@ apped or killed .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation Dra@@ wn by Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies living with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force through organised crime and the fight against it ming@@ led with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mor@@ des a day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ pren@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug trade that has tortured the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he is linked include images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what about the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to per@@ sist .
take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to receive messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated by this . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to sail .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses br@@ ushed and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned beyond recognition .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ gu@@ r user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it features rows of carbon@@ ated bodies which are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photograph was put up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only satellite images could show the follow @-@ up time figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments like this example mistakenly counter@@ act the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi news site that pur@@ port@@ edly claimed that Myanmar &apos;s president has allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not taken the picture from DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false oppel@@ ungen reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse order search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited some examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries on which side they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range clearer than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been connected ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive usage .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of wrong copies of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false noti@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show fal@@ si@@ fications .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ tales after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am as this one here , who used the picture from DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the fla@@ wed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post by the American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s bombing in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , which expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt by a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uting , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a correction on what it came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpos@@ ely resour@@ ced news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which only appeared in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech are running and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; angi@@ ographic angi@@ ography . &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic nearby An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital news page , has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of DR Congo showed that this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ ated more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced itself .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) also depic@@ t Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which first appeared clearly after the original play of 2010 , the picture ultimately may have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
social media have dozens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share their share of drinking water around a tragedy .
does this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and im@@ pe@@ des the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the proliferation of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , and they have the ability to emp@@ ower emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent ima@@ gery in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used in context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ translated ) endeav@@ ours to offer language inspir@@ es a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ cer ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ knife ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context is required in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ash@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Det@@ ect your parents in recognition of how they have worked for you in your younger years .
and words in the h@@ uns@@ et@@ rics language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
k@@ w@@ adi - The la@@ z@@ iness or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite wine here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floods and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement by the Sri Lanka catastrophe centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dges .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were moved to 304 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly declining .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge to the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floods ham@@ mer@@ ing the Den@@ gue fever , save the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and five other five aircraft will be completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in the flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 49 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 7@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi @-@ U@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) requests anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cad@@ ast@@ ral centre is informed .
last year , after the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button allowing users to call up a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also launched a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat recovery actions for floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and contribute funds .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , and Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .
the Muslims that You Can &apos;t See
the Women &apos;s March on 21 . January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next , we are calling for trans@@ gender rights .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they kid@@ nap me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit into it , are muscular .
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry is widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? what &apos;s your favorite ?
to be in peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting accounts for a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been col@@ oni@@ fying Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ sec@@ ted the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to pursue it .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades have led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , Saudi and Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who insti@@ gate movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we relate them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
of the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we are more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to understand the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh , named Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at the time Khan re @-@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a native Muslim and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or hand@@ some hand@@ bags worn by all Muslims - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I j@@ est , we do not carry all the hand@@ bills with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic refin@@ ery machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we relate them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who r@@ ushes a woman &apos;s veil .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity so far , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to the protection , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they be protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an icon contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters eventually pos@@ ing in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; like decades ago she won a contest of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a nation that - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; a company called Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ in@@ die Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was crying over his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ic sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I was ever , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across each continent from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy visits the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Mohammed was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim , and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , which are multiple times , but fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion houses more possibilities than a magic dice , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries it bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; targeting largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we run and the bombs we throw off on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to dis@@ ori@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous im@@ prints that we are getting in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims inside the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten stories .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ M@@ ica Bad@@ han ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage by the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who have existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now running the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me a vital Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that might evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and that people are dis@@ credited by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , even scientist of Stan@@ ford even four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I imagine a new future in which we don &apos;t have a president who feeds the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often is connected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Listen to appreciate , feel , make friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will introduce their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and representation contribute to the audience getting involved .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ lie@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico calls for new government debt to be re @-@ established
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debts of Puerto Rico , which amounted to USD 72 million , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic Front for the Ne@@ ural Ex@@ am@@ ination of Deb@@ t ) and the Roman Church Convention &quot; Puerto Rico . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debt are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a line of management without personal interests on public debts , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remun@@ eration that operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island , which is not integrated into the state alliance , is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state &apos;s infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from the outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of book S@@ prints , published excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inves@@ tigation ) .
the book published last year , which is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of es@@ says that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for Free Knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free the Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il Bass@@ el , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book , entitled Collec@@ tive Memory , gives his friends and family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; had taken P@@ asha on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the P@@ asha , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes looked more fores@@ ighted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would make every effort to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and wrote about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overcome when I call his name .
he taught me English , even when he was in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight of the moment in which we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with me with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will let another piece of my soul be with you ...
I quickly turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all those moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the incar@@ cer@@ ation of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
during the day
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , until 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of bass since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Mozambique : re @-@ sentenced to previous post due to corruption
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison .
the money came from the public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Chief Financial Officer Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which took place on 19th April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action very well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards for the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently remained silent and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been shut down .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has con@@ s@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and political science student in Brazil says the director does not have any moral values :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him . I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lack the morality to return and serve the State , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself had become we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral accounts , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of selling his own individual interest , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he spent 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he funds money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ so@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ w ir@@ retri@@ eved round ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Mozambique :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting balls . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network recorded their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook is cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; in @-@ the @-@ out &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma over the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dist@@ ressing con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt in order to express their use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ops believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words alongside .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words often becomes a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook removed .
in the post office , the author shared his view of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but that &apos;s not how it works .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started without local context or technical support and banned such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now mock Facebook and don &apos;t consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech , but still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have been using social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to concentrate more on context than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ s@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , said that the state should not interfere with the fact that the state would not interfere with the age , as it did not determine the age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , which defines min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and by 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they were supposed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dam@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : bill against the to@@ e was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of ministry in the ministry of education , said :
it has used too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the heart of the matter , but you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the design for the amend@@ ment to the Act of the Act was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were present have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally prohibited in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight against abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization .
months ago Mahar@@ aj proc@@ la@@ ims his intention to take legal steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wants to act against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject otherwise .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we , &quot; inviting the state into our bedrooms , &quot; would simply say that the state , our daughters from it , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in the advantage of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view the Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and TV series fans defend themselves against blocking .
although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking its Wikipedia article since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several M@@ irr@@ ors pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computers connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after listening to the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all started to lay Sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia &apos;s contents even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors pages when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is done by a server not in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;

S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and washed out colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring N@@ ept@@ une wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was right at home when I suddenly called myself back to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a leop@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is only a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately started to crack pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .

I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ cks appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the further@@ ance of nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot footage of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding women with the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling on a married relative with a name .
the tradition their wives also do not mention by name is also common among men . however , they have far less assignment to fear , if any , they should not come to this practice .
in the little village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main meeting of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as child marriage and ban@@ ishing HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak out loud in the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they have all du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without moral .
the tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband ling@@ ered long after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion sk@@ lu@@ b with this confidence in luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all asked , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the cr@@ ushing of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ g@@ gled before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rou@@ gh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it as well .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lun@@ ches and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ve @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they did not dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion so that the women could wear it .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed during the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear ver@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to only 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was home to the H@@ ash@@ tag in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is regarded as the turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ ia , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted for the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit in 2016 :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aca , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . we were here in Tokyo at the age of 51 .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places associated with the band .
when you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will go .
so , we hope you are there !

man @-@ headed men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that the bald @-@ headed men could be attacked by attacks in Mozambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique , are al@@ armed by a new system of ab@@ duction of bald people for the organ trade , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes . the local government has now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken out .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can hold gold or bring wealth , said the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique as target @-@ headed men in Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ aic police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald @-@ headed men .
the persecution and murder of cross @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ kan@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for supposedly ab@@ err@@ atic rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT IS ashamed A country where the people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , and to take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to attain fast wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic social t@@ witter @-@ user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ kan@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the polic@@ eman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 in Arabic B@@ logger .
in November 2015 , Ba@@ ader &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who out@@ si@@ ders themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and Constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we will be honoured above all by creating bass as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been deployed in the last five years for his release .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said a spokesman , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to enable him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some responses from abroad .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . Norway signed an agreement until June to resume the exports to China , as exports had largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to aboli@@ sh all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; wish him the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he helped him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokesperson of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P News Agency on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the US embassy was a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told the couple that China should offer the following services to the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , upon which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can enter a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had major concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um keeps telling :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release them for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan in Taiwan
the Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful remedies to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the governing Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellbeing .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he seemed inv@@ ari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers , who preten@@ ded to be democr@@ ats , for@@ s@@ aken the twisted logic , as it fits better to its power .
during the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam the responses to his American guests regarding our press , our dict@@ ator , our political system were really non @-@ answers .
he could answer corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should begin to read the whole address of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw for decades a party winning ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as the leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes he really is associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , are we only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet &apos;s cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they not defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine expands to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , exposed to rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are cooking indign@@ ant when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all the Canadi@@ ans love .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
mit Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means being sk@@ ewer @-@ like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada were really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and paying no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background un@@ noticed , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool poli@@ ten@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness I now associate with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau decided to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band in Thailand has published a music video that is par@@ o@@ ding the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and , despite its promise to re @-@ establish the civilian government , continued to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend is doing .
although not explicitly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 list@@ ings .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these shots of the video , referring to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recruitment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that supervised online content and prosec@@ uted individuals who accused the monarchy .
Thailand op@@ poses a strict faction against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the tribute of Pan@@ em , who was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ es@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ ch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ que war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ ch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ kal@@ a are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asi@@ ans , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ ch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly asc@@ ended for over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s called K@@ hr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ko , which still houses one or two families , is recognised on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both of them seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they retreat immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the laps .
in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was eleven years old when the war began .
every day , it re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia collap@@ sed simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and h@@ ens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation turns to the end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones onto the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommod@@ ates migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border between Mexico and Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear format .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rates , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she does not want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived shortly .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a go@@ at@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , they normally have a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans are already speaking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy got weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests send her often text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez might be very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead @-@ end street leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have accommod@@ ated migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown woman , a single mother , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers should consult their phones calm@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ ma she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ lich@@ ens she has made one client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she tells me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you &apos;ve already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi announced a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message is said that the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities k@@ not use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they installed the app , they exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the app would investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their home network .
this app , using filtering for min@@ ors , is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ acker to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , troubled ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the cens@@ ored news in China published photos from a check@@ point to which police inspec@@ tors checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the care technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( in the past ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , indicating that the software can lift the password request from a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all branches of government , authorities and the party connected to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office to operate their computers and communication devices .
a recent release by Freedom House , a US @-@ based human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to send their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; to the local police until August 1 .
the intent is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; - but this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything that is important has van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible from both inside and outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who makes all glory to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything is crying out after death .
all doubts settle in smoke and you become aware of your existence even if the earth continues on the axis of the un@@ holy . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not have high demands on a city that has been stuffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted with silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends , joined me ; we joined a splendid image that filled my expectation completely and completely .
in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I got a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were looking at me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest maintenance that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was suspended for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I take care of all the details before I enter the room .
in other words , this time they shared a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and I am allowed to sit at once without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ time communication method : to strike against the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a distinguished middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness there are no apparent traits of sight attached to me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would let him go if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ori@@ ously lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close vision of their view of the world .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life as you join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
to pun@@ ish@@ ments in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the se@@ wer .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough to him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present themselves to us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them inter@@ changed while I was still in the front row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any pleasure in it , which is why he acted as the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two aw@@ ful hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ fully concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they guide me ? !
Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bs to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ em@@ power@@ ment against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation &quot; - he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and was never in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so much about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water he po@@ urs Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the war@@ ks speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan organised a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement .
the MP and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ filtr@@ ates the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably shouldn &apos;t be simply rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflecting an increasingly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex organ by em@@ power@@ ing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ es &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official out@@ wards left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary massac@@ res reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to adequately support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 law of crime against crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known not to shy away from issues that are long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was informed of politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the Palestinian identity question .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse repe@@ ats stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed up was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ it , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is asking himself : if Abu Nu@@ it , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jordan do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ aching Association , stating that they have critic@@ ised social media comment@@ aries on the problems associated with deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without foreign intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial ways @-@ made demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two flo@@ ats are to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a car of 18 meters high was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely external appearances and personal care have been as important as in this story , as they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the out@@ going hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more regular citizens moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate compassion towards people who feel pushed out ?
it was precisely this question that the young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga no longer had from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la En@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , which encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which is the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before Colom@@ bians lies a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , had been subjected to a rhet@@ oric of war and lifted their arms around the clock , must now integrate again into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must unite and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
&quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter made me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters lived ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go into , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gar@@ net , a le@@ thal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has never written something so beautiful in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over my che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment were very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters replied to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
Colom@@ bians were made aware that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article auth@@ ored by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ brand@@ Sum@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
homos@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of threats - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community as a women &apos;s sword has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who det@@ ained suspici@@ ously qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she eventually moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her away without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; so there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last time .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which dispens@@ aries were you placed - in which the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor knew and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February I received threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was wrong .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering me , without badge , without all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re safe just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about sex adaptation , however , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really take pains to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who locked in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not complete a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood grati@@ fication has experienced .
OC Media : will gay men still be captured in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many people .
if , above all , those who do not have wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn into Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken with him .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was true I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , but finally cast us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ led me only a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ ra@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel the people in the city began to change .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at before gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you currently have ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
besides , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent on it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I tap the type of refuge .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men there .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think at transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different settings of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian indigenous population suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video , shared on YouTube , held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights told me that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have met .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who , due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 participated in great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the local population only receives little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , famine and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the a@@ haw@@ k youngsters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian CEO for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % graduated from university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
as function@@ aries and institutions do not favour Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to make a living outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
in view of the circumstances the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identified with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale fem@@ inists - have fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass of glass sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to skin colour , racism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
and yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices &quot; and &quot; to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to say that there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider ine@@ qualities in her mind , which refer both to gender and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has again and again rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an ab@@ u@@ sive and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better one .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of myself entirely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advocate for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ izer : Rec@@ la@@ iming , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al fem@@ inists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mus@@ a recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ Captain Alliance - a subsidiary of the Water@@ park Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker based in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ resses oppressed churches to tell their stories in their own way .

a police commission@@ er , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had been violent to her .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s meti@@ culous ad did not help .
a few days later , the second wife with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women refund an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to being victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mal@@ treated , says my@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office filed 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of police ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the dishes of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will come to every woman who will not do so due to physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since female suicide is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
in August 2016 alone , journalists en@@ umer@@ ated at least 12 cases of female suicide in the country .
the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Human Rights Co@@ ordin@@ ator documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos herself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed it so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mal@@ treatment had at least some blame on it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take seriously the statements made by women .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen ECH@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ emp@@ ties ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ ici@@ dal to an independent perpet@@ rator and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text was changed in some respects , in order to win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be level@@ ed , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is pun@@ ishable by up to five years in prison .
the original draft law fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence must bear on their own , if they simply refuse to report and receive a secure housing to impose the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away with imp@@ unity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was painted which the partners were calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are taking apart .
the passage concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media still subjected to attacks in Oman a year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available on the homepage of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Mexican authorities closed the Independent Arab @-@ language Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has been the main office in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , First Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s reign is characterised by the stub@@ born efforts of the security forces , especially domestic intelligence , to restrict public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , to torture and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , concluded that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in an inheritance law@@ suit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the head@@ line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties retain the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS was awarded the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who after Al @-@ Ma@@ zz@@ is arrested as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper is prohibited in any way , including online , as of 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ kat in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating the ban of publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year prohibition of occupation was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic rift ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to happen again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again placed himself against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ open the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ ald and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Mexican authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive infrin@@ gement of the freedom of the press .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , is calling on the Mexican authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper , Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial kill@@ ings .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjoining states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare sector , covering the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists helps build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he even resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
Q : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a joke .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here .
the system that magazines can only make articles against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions to environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 grades , such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton continues to grow salad , but now he needs longer because his work is increasingly ham@@ pered by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock b@@ oul@@ der in a river to whom I have to d@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far in salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand up to court , no one can breed a new kind of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to make as good as possible and tries to extract the traits he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever larger in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , cross it to breed their own varieties and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
Professor der University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; the latest examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source seed initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast to this , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly shr@@ inking due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights to plant material , which is thus more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all car@@ tels are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all or difficult .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ ons
plants are grown so that they exhibit intentionally desired traits - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for gro@@ wers takes more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more pressing than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is limiting other breeders since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection is not inhibit@@ ing innovations , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : wait 20 years for a patent to run , certainly not promoting innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers their job easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in it as well .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation masses her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most of the smaller seed companies are able to survive without patents - either they reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks as though I was more powerful with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I always need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
although the United States seems to be a leader in the open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , imple@@ ments an open @-@ source seed programme . in order to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to gro@@ wers in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , announced that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it claims against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up will be scheduled for the next year .
an association of environmental protection and development assistance groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - publishes a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ NU@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation has fallen victim to the wave of web barriers . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to the AN@@ NU@@ I , the blog by colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider who is also a resident of the Spi@@ Å¡ blog , is still available .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his article revol@@ ves mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the ban by the government and reflected what this means to him :
to ban blo@@ gs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i priority ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in im@@ par@@ ting me with the feeling of a siege state ; an arrest , a attempted murder , an invitation to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website I was working for .
2 ) You proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
in their research , af@@ te reported :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the decisions taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these acts before courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in all of Brazil report with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second @-@ largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is killed , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist writes in the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 domains which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ ilia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence can be called a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public sector .
in memory , Rio de Janeiro State is greater than its capital .

according to Cec@@ ilia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ ila , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these measures included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police grid and permanently establishing a unity there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also weighs serious consequences for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a blur@@ red point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the people of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died due to shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the ad video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime over loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside of Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local people are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organisers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more well @-@ known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used .
it is planned to teach 125 families to transplan@@ t fung@@ i , according to Dr. Lei@@ la , Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of seeds originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities which are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a period of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ za - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the Ab@@ y@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to limit the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Government of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they didn &apos;t do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in places with a high risk of fire .
a sweeping proposal for the forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , always spread to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application fo@@ v .@@ pt , it used the own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

in a night of autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so , she knew she would no longer see her son any more - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left behind his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to need@@ les twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin ratios . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the registration of the application for asylum .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af placed all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened another hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ an companies have ar@@ isen , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals range well beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ge plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and con@@ serving techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt permit the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ i Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international sn@@ apshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering at a government office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must opt @-@ in to use social networks within six months after submitting a bill of law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identity number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a criminal payment .
the Act , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is supposed to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another Member of Parliament issued a legislative proposal that would har@@ den har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the president &apos;s or senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the law , such a deed would be pun@@ ishable by prison and fin@@ es , according to the legal experts of the Media Office for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for those convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating force against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including arms control , illegal assembly , murder and attempt to kill .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza pronounced the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si block block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , 25 years ago to 5 years .
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists to peer @-@ reviewed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated on a comprehensive action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , who explicitly supports a controversial draft law , would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally preserved mon@@ ies .
the document released on April 21 , published on the Na@@ wa@@ in website , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating that Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code provides journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the case of the District Court in Tunis on 9 May .
will China force the users of social media to show their identity ?
according to the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China information offices , users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media .
the rules also indicate that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts expect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it is unclear up to now how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we see then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , Russian state cens@@ orship imposed access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the information broad@@ ening . &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications told us that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source collabor@@ ating with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is blocking the website completely . it is therefore , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor @-@ programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telec@@ oms operators and secret services in relation to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
