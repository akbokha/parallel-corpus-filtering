<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, reading American authors and practising his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only reinforced by my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotry person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also agreed with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in play.</seg>
<seg id="25">The slinging intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican candidate for presidency, she offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters themselves as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an incapacity to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters who are most aware voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down contempt for those looking different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (meaning "White vs. all other ethnicities"); white and whiplash play in white and whiplash, which means whiplash injuries), as the great Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For he chose this country as his president, twice the son of a Kenan, whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, a vast majority of white America pledges this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayr Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do African Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan completed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "this is now Trump's Land," "" "said the news." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is situated on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave young people a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - play instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop on musical instruments in Cateurura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonics follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters, before the other coast of Africa was sought.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset about this and reluctant to welcome a criminal of this kind to their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything" "", "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia due to looting of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, alongside Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that drove the prime minister from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and support each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project" "" "Ending Illegal Fishing" "". "this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden, which is why it is extremely difficult to track down. this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail empo, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions are now in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas. also, suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. this means that ships cannot sell their cargo and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to regain reputed 20 million USD in lost sales, which lost the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishing that invades East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world, including illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of imaginary names, fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say" "" "You cannot run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and exactly this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspicions of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escape ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency to fight crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">Illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that is what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO focusing on fishing data and providing technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland is helping to build a system that connects different information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminally operating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Reserve Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be used to display the position of each tractable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what where - it just makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unify and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also scaring them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fish without a license, and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors arrived there on the towing nets which were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There, in 2015, six countries joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they now fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also entered into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is further escalating: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of" "" "conquering the country" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="153">The motions in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">When the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were in place, reacted by meeting in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country, among others in the lowland region of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central-north of the federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the State of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition looked at the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the discontinuation of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-working at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the rate of inflation and violence belong to the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment for many is considered the only way to recapture its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, urged the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve-hour strike at the next day as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, should continue to block the referendum on the removal of the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all after Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that tell about quarrels, as well as reports of repression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean state of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which shows the extent of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from its point of view, has little against the disastrous economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship have been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not yet realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a gendarmerie. during the 1974-1983 Argentinian military dictatorship, his father was deputy commander of intelligence department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor responsible for kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall.</seg>

<seg id="347">In Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, witnessed a particularly unsuccessful translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word was transferred to the "older car"; the "older car" means, erroneously - perhaps also with bad back-thought & # 8212; as "horseatic motorists" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edit the original photos of Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-published daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could an English translation come about?" ""</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the faulty english translation was first removed. the designation" "" "bad drivers" "" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" older drivers "" ""). "" "</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture has apologized for the translation error. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people were insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "Japanese online news service J-Cast News explained a little more detail about the phenomenon of" "" "terrific" "" "motorists in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, which are involved in accidents across the country, is quite an occasion for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">There are many reasons for the widespread dissemination of translation errors.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, nevertheless allow translations to be made internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is best estimated, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The discernible and enigmatic sentences, which are caused by machine translation, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto, hopefully, uses a reputable source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the Internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositional groups, which oppose the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was groping and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enables your VPN to be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are blocked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Vivoplay offers are popular with Internet access from Venezolans, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VEinfilintro, later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Past research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, has shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it is also reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multi-media coverage of current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay, many girls become slaves to receive training</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadia as a child. she now visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies from other Criadians, who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. used with kind permission of structural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a report written by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, Fall Schools"), edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride speaking about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criadilla, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children do have to pay for countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that in the framework of a contract that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice designated as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Criadians is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society, and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with him and justifies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know of it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the so far unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households receives a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body was showing traces of violent strikes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the local registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved on a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the Criadazgo's practice deeply rooted in the Paraguayan community for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows than children are registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to offend the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to justice, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-breaking - for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo comes to justice.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Life of a Criadia</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criadians are exploited not only as labour-workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik party, in which her father worked, had to enrol in bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of her employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but never got unlimited food. "I could fetch more books from the landlord's library than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>

<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even at school, Alvarenga is discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken of is bullying and the harassment that Criadians are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image from Pixabay, edited by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty-six Egyptian MPs recently voted in favour of a draft bill on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when it is adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that is going through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users from the telecommunications ministry received a user name and password to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the ground are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German "leading research technologist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR), "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as well as they might be violent physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensuring that no deviating narration is present on the image space, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the Iraqi Kurdistan Mountains in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights campaigner Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of the leopards, who fight through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1.000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find always less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance of seeing a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is passionately pointing another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">She has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and advocates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region are set up.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo newspaper responsible for northeastern Japan, the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state prefect in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this purpose, Fukushima Prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident, already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-homes were completed (in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these homes while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of accommodation establishments (the "" "" kashetsu uutchu ") must be resettled to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuates from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who stayed after the disaster in accommodation establishments, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three Prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were hit by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial rebuilding is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours in Fukushima have resumed their operations.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50% destroyed cultivated farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrage zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants are experiencing it as more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population being prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation companies. she questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their sensitivity has changed from the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How to evacuate those who had to evacuate the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper increased their attention to the situation of the evacuation companies from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuates from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. they are known to bring them back to correct dwellings because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we're watching these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love for music has consolidated its affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer attacked him during a demonstration in Goiana with a strike against the head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march across the country.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be shown on TV for six months and the entire suppression would thus be justified.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remember exactly that MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane mill, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already opposed the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality had better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound must remain, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural Prospectivs" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go down in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the years that followed, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the location to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It consisted of officially written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">Against his will, he was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by teacher David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop aims to encourage young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street in West-Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were drowned or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a Strophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the stopper is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will rise</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way, they can grow and also advance our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has destined to do.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is right on the menu, they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin delicately (all-in-the-out, "plastic models of dishes") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tobobish district of Kappabashi, there are a lot of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is now turning it into conspicuous mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the blogger itinii released a series of social media links and photos which show this unusual twist with the shokuhin purple.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone straps, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shovels fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a Kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple containing your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phones, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes you can view at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # 2 on Twitter for the time of the hashtag.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed persons regularly appear only in statistics. these, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of conflict to the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the bereaved or the communities who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone find, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "apprena Vivir Con El Narco" ("Living with the Drug Trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who are caught up in the battle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Times Edited") narrates these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who looks for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensation-journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me down.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin will think he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the non-crime of the people is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified with the fact that they were" "" "sod" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to concede that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not move and are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the Capital District: how a family has been looted with threats." in this, she describes how armed criminals hired money from their business month after month, until they had destroyed not only the business, but also tore down their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you do not know when they will be kidnapped or killed.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation Drawn by Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies living with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a force through organised crime and the fight against it mingled with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office numbered 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mordes a day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "apprena Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug trade that has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>

<seg id="820">Take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to receive messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a truck traversed the place Sange in the east of DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated by this. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to sail.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses brushed and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned beyond recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It features rows of carbonated bodies which are lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph was put up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only satellite images could show the follow-up time figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments like this example mistakenly counteract the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi news site that purportedly claimed that Myanmar's president has allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site wrongly claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein Sein admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and retweated more than 9,300 times), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">Social media have dozens of people who inadvertently share their share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of misinformation and misinformation suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and impedes the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers, and they have the ability to empower empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent imagery in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used in context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. untranslated) endeavours to offer language inspires a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saucer) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobreknife).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes context is required in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They kidnap me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like me, do not fit into it, are muscular.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, Saudi and Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other." as my girlfriend and I imagine a new future in which we don't have a president who feeds the chocolate cake, while he already bombed broken lands and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storytelling wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often is connected," "" "these events instead" "" "Listen to appreciate, feel, make friends." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers will introduce their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation contribute to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassilieou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the rabbits and the baboon in the Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" he shares his sense of inclusiveness with a wide grin:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling tours.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for new government debt to be re-established</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to USD 72 million, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Civic Front for the Neural Examination of Debt) and the Roman Church Convention "Puerto Rico."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reestablishment of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debt are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a line of management without personal interests on public debts, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration that operates in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of book Sprints, published excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Investigation).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year, which is available royalty-free, contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for Free Knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free the Khartouil Bassel, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book, entitled Collective Memory, gives his friends and family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" had taken Pasha on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Pasha, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes looked more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel couldn't know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would make every effort to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and wrote about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overcome when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">He taught me English, even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabbook that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every time you visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose sight of the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">That I carry with me with passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will let another piece of my soul be with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly turn back to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all those moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuade myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, until 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of bass since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: re-sentenced to previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Chief Financial Officer Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which took place on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action very well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards for the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not induce appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza is a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and political science student in Brazil says the director does not have any moral values:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him. I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack the morality to return and serve the State, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself had become weary of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Mahel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral accounts, when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man was capable of selling his own individual interest, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he spent 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he funds money, sets him back under contract. # AssoVaiOMeuPais - Ñw irretrieved round (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (in German: @ truth) states that criminality pays off in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splitting balls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network recorded their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censoring the word "Kalar" or "in-the-out" (in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma over the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely distressing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt in order to express their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence" "" "ku" "" "-" "" "cure" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hops believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words alongside.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords often becomes a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post office, the author shared his view of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but that's not how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started without local context or technical support and banned such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now mock Facebook and don't consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have been using social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to concentrate more on context than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and by 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children, they were supposed to" "" "damn" "" "about their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: bill against the toe was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministry in the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has used too much time and unnecessary talk, which has concealed the heart of the matter, but you know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years independent of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the amendment to the Act of the Act was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations. congratulations.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most well-known Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj proclaims his intention to take legal steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to deliver his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wants to act against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that we, "inviting the state into our bedrooms," would simply say that the state, our daughters from it, protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in the advantage of them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was shown on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>

<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and TV series fans defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking its Wikipedia article since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several Mirrors pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computers connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we all started to lay Snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia's contents even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrors pages when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlendes Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed out colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Neptune wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was right at home when I suddenly called myself back to Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was, and I immediately started to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was already standing on face to face with [the] face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb himself from the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Bucks appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the furtherance of nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot footage of Ottern at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding women with the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was convicted by a pseudo-court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling on a married relative with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition their wives also do not mention by name is also common among men. however, they have far less assignment to fear, if any, they should not come to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the little village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main meeting of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as child marriage and banishing HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak out loud in the name of their husbands is a custom, which they have all dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply entrenched that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband lingered long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion sklub with this confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they all asked, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paine from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the crushing of an age-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Roughini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it as well.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunches and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salve-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed during the five months since its first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear vernoberred on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling over more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to only 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in Japan in 1966 is regarded as the turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumia, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted for the 50th anniversary of the first visit in 2016:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cult band's music is "more than just a universal language as English," said Ryuichi Isaca, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan. we were here in Tokyo at the age of 51.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.</seg>

<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">When you love the Beatles, this is your 5 places you absolutely need to visit.</seg>

<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">The police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique, are alarmed by a new system of abduction of bald people for the organ trade, presumably for superstitious purposes. the local government has now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and some of the organs were taken out.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald man can hold gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ucombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique as target-headed men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, warned the mosaic police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushai Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald-headed men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of cross-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Morkanbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for supposedly aberratic rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THAT IS ashamed A country where the people would have shame to go to the streets, to demand sex against good marks, and to take their lives to earn their bread, a country where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for indulgent purposes or "black magic" are hunted that aim to attain fast wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic social twitter-user, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morkanbala, Pedro Sapange, as well as the policeman ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both bald-headed:</seg>
<seg id="1606">The Muslim authorities are very concerned about the killings of bald people.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and said a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to enable him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some responses from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. Norway signed an agreement until June to resume the exports to China, as exports had largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members." ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans "wish him the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he helped him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced AFP News Agency on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the request of the US embassy was a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">He told the couple that China should offer the following services to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, upon which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany and Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin that Liu "receives all the medical support he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters reported that China had major concerns about whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum keeps telling:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release them for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures need to be taken to ensure Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful remedies to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, of the governing Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmuamalgam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmuamalgam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers, who pretended to be democrats, forsaken the twisted logic, as it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the final week of Shanmuamalgam the responses to his American guests regarding our press, our dictator, our political system were really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He could answer corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmuamalgam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuamalgam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should begin to read the whole address of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmuamalgam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw for decades a party winning?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuamalgam, which makes such a polemical statement as the leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yv and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes he really is associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "make a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, are we only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Cabinet's cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they not defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, the Journey of a Decade magazine expands to Bejahung, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band in Thailand has published a music video that is paroding the junta, which in 2014 took power and, despite its promise to re-establish the civilian government, continued to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend is doing.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video relates indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8.800 listings.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these shots of the video, referring to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program of the" "" "recruitment change" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Junta." ""</seg>

<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army that supervised online content and prosecuted individuals who accused the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand opposes a strict faction against "Lese Majestic" (Majesty insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment if they insult the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asians, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people, having hardly ascended for over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43,000 people lived in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear format.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez narrates, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balsam the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a goatee) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, they normally have a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Afrika is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that the Africans are already speaking about Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy got weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez narrates that her guests send her often text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez might be very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead-end street leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have accommodated migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown woman, a single mother, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers should consult their phones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-lichens she has made one client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she tells me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "you've already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">An easy-to-use check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi announced a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the message is said that the app will prevent" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities knot use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they installed the app, they exchanged news with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "the police reported that the app would investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online scams, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, using filtering for minors, is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable government actors or even hacker to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, troubled ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The censored news in China published photos from a checkpoint to which police inspectors checked the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the care technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (in the past) also published a Jingwang product description, indicating that the software can lift the password request from a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, authorities and the party connected to the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office to operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent release by Freedom House, a US-based human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to send their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" to the local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intent is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" - but this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slumbs to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as fellows (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questions its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special disempowerment against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee from the second generation" - he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and was never in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so much about my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib emphasizes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water he pours NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the warks speak lukewarm coffee and the Schwaden of the Kent-cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan organised a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which infiltrates the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably shouldn't be simply rhetoric, but in fact reflecting an increasingly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved to Leibe's traditional sex organ by empowering his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'honourable mores' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outwards left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary massacres reached its peak in 2016; however, it is aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to adequately support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 law of crime against crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known not to shy away from issues that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was informed of politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib is attacking the Palestinian identity question.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse repeats strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed up was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuit, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is asking himself: if Abu Nuit, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordan do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the Teaching Association, stating that they have criticised social media commentaries on the problems associated with deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without foreign intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificial ways-made democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting that Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we had a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two floats are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearances and personal care have been as important as in this story, as they help to keep Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the outgoing hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more regular citizens moving into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hair styles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dressing tools and to receive training in hairdresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate compassion towards people who feel pushed out?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It was precisely this question that the young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga no longer had from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la EnliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), which encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which is the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before Colombians lies a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, had been subjected to a rhetoric of war and lifted their arms around the clock, must now integrate again into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must unite and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before, in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter made me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters lived) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL garnet, a lethal weapon in the Sleeping Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "someone has never written something so beautiful in my life, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran over my cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">The New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment were very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians were made aware that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last time.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which dispensaries were you placed - in which the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor knew and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>

<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registering me, without badge, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message:" "" "you don't believe me, you're safe just because you have left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't talk about sex adaptation, however, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really take pains to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who locked in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not complete a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" through blood gratification has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will gay men still be captured in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many people.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who do not have wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn into Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation have already occurred in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was true I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to bring us to the" "" "Civilization" "" "originally, but finally cast us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never curled me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharrama Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at before gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you currently have?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Besides, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent on it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I tap the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men there.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have which, the cabarins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think at transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different settings of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian indigenous population suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jasim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video, shared on YouTube, held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told me that this month several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have met.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who, due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government, were helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 participated in great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing slowly, and the local population only receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, famine and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams to divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian CEO for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% graduated from university.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist based in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicides among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As functionaries and institutions do not favour Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to make a living outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectionale feminists - have frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass of glass sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to skin colour, racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">And yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices" and "to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider inequalities in her mind, which refer both to gender and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has again and again rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an abusive and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better one.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself entirely from feminism and join the movement of womanism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocate for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanizer: Reclaiming, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soft-haired), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner, Ada BÃ¡ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had been violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to maltreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez's meticulous ad did not help.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women refund an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to being victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really maltreated, says myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institute in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos herself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed it so long by Carlos and didn't leave it before.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare sector, covering the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists helps build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he even researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Ssamba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Q: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a joke.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make articles against payment (the so-called Paywall) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions to environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 grades, such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carrot varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton continues to grow salad, but now he needs longer because his work is increasingly hampered by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock boulder in a river to whom I have to dump." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far in salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand up to court, no one can breed a new kind of salad, because all the features are already patented. "he continues to make as good as possible and tries to extract the traits he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever larger in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red RÃ¶mersalat of OutredGorgeous variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, cross it to breed their own varieties and do not immediately send out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor der University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," the latest examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source seed initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast to this, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is unceasingly shrinking due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights to plant material, which is thus more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all cartels are protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all or difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they exhibit intentionally desired traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, because they thrive in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for growers takes more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more pressing than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the view that intellectual property is limiting other breeders since" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection is not inhibiting innovations, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: wait 20 years for a patent to run, certainly not promoting innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In general Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant features: "we do not really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi Executive Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in it as well.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation masses herbicides are needed, breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are smaller than Monsanto are) patents, most of the smaller seed companies are able to survive without patents - either they reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant patrons: "it looks as though I was more powerful with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seems to be a leader in the open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, implements an open-source seed programme. in order to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, announced that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it claims against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>

<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start-up will be scheduled for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental protection and development assistance groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANNUI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation has fallen victim to the wave of web barriers. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to the ANNUI, the blog by columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider who is also a resident of the SpiÅ¡ blog, is still available.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article revolves mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the ban by the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To ban blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in imparting me with the feeling of a siege state; an arrest, a attempted murder, an invitation to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blocking of providers, which was possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">In their research, afte reported:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the decisions taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these acts before courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all of Brazil report with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second-largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is killed," "Thieves robbed the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "Extra" "" "published in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">It will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., but what happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist writes in the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 domains which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecilia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence can be called a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory, Rio de Janeiro State is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecilia, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecila, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These measures included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police grid and permanently establishing a unity there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"" "" "" "in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also weighs serious consequences for the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="2786">This includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a blurred point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the people of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a salesman died due to shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime over loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside of Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local people are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more well-known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnahda, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to transplant fungi, according to Dr. Leila, Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with the" "" "production of seeds originating from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in Eastern Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a period of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, always spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fov .pt, it used the own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an abandoned building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left behind his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needles twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin ratios. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the registration of the application for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf placed all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened another hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghan companies have arisen, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals range well beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forge plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conserving techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen's report: bill drafts from Egypt permit the shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abi Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Share photos of @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering at a government office." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must opt-in to use social networks within six months after submitting a bill of law on the authority's website, stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is supposed to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another Member of Parliament issued a legislative proposal that would harden harsher penalties for the president's or senior officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under the law, such a deed would be punishable by prison and fines, according to the legal experts of the Media Office for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years in prison for those convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating force against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup d'Ã©tat of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including arms control, illegal assembly, murder and attempt to kill.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza pronounced the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mossad al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi block blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, 25 years ago to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists to peer-reviewed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated on a comprehensive action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, who explicitly supports a controversial draft law, would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all illegally preserved monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document released on April 21, published on the Nawain website, sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources, stating that Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code provides journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the case of the District Court in Tunis on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to show their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the information offices of the People's Republic of China information offices, users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts expect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks. it is unclear up to now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see then in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, Russian state censorship imposed access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the "organiser of the information broadening."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled the Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications told us that the site was closed because it was" "" "an information source collaborating with groups to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey is blocking the website completely. it is therefore, among other things, China, one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor-programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecoms operators and secret services in relation to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
