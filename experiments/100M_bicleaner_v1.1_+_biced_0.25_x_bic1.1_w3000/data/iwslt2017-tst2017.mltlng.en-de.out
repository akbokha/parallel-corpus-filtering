this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA have heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed down literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government has been investigating bre@@ aches and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Senate , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous people they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters were already doing before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been claiming years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to crack .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing and making cracks , that could also be done by his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly procu@@ red his telephone calls .
just like his email , financial and banking information , his credit information , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack of alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ns than all US governments in front of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work at stake , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as government technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that has not yet been available , as a crack had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed further by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill off@@ ences . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
or the nearest environ@@ ment@@ alist , the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the greatest piece of history of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#93; This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident Law Fir@@ m Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys go to firms like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are being used by a few of them to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all over the world seem to be very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these expos@@ ures to this scandal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , need less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator retired as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked the fact that all except one lawyer , our investig@@ ator , made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took care of us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
that may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has recorded in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is here to lag behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are campaig@@ ning to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale .
a guy in the Red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where sleep@@ est thou tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock up there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , slept on ti@@ p@@ toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art which he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view point .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moved out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to make something . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room that doors are closed when a visit is over .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design achieve such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
type your corresponding mobile phone to your left @-@ wing neighbour .
this soft touch of panic you now feel -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores cell phone ?
could you please share on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name ; if he had told us where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can truly capture very well @-@ developed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests submitted their assessments before they presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation origin@@ ates in simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art works in your home ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can design be created to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which had not been met before .
for us , business is going very well .
of course , there are times when things are not going smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I was involved in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million nights had a problem .
for people have confidence in each other .
if trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know a real one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books to pass .
they can even stay longer without charge of extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will fail .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this concept , I wondered :
how does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there resident would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub tour quarter of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than soli@@ tude and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents now . students who were looking for a place of residence ,
were given to people whose children had moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
the hospitality was already warm .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it star@@ tling ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most of them don &apos;t know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ st myself .
no , not as a homos@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover the Hi@@ j@@ ab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and , like all the good Egyptians , started my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should we do such things ?
I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; Eastern origin ... &quot; &quot; ... jihadi@@ st ... &quot; &quot; sm@@ ashed Mak@@ k@@ ah ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and begin post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warning sounded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims in the open and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this land have attacked our land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have pushed the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love asking .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumour in the body of the USA .
the question is : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it will perhaps keep a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
as first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts of the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to find a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ marked the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of true change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if you submit to Test@@ individuals messages that have a negative report on Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
the assignment of collective guilt is not just about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented in the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother made such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had visited Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopping me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congreg@@ ations were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h mind factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool yourself . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did the largest ever study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it &apos;s efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of tail star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying machines , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies with only one function .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the most mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ation or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , very much happens in the inner life , so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere .
but it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the tail switch . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right , if everyone looks at me is low , so I show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in self @-@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some of them can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when assembling them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if anything goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half of them un@@ fit .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe press , on the other hand , wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us is the wages in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ve around each other in a very far away gal@@ axy , so that they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is here -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially cour@@ te@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition capacity enormously .
that is why it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to solve some minor problems with persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes explored through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector , too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
in order to illustrate the theory of rel@@ ativity , teachers often lead a truly al@@ ber@@ n@@ istic dance .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even lu@@ dic@@ rous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ ped at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points .
that &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
for instance , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now just Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been occupied for very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same pair with an additional key change . this sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as it was never possible before .
on this road we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not see .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because they are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night @-@ light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o @-@ Project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o sees them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sau@@ rian bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos &apos;s ru@@ stling and cir@@ cus .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just doing what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life pro@@ found@@ ly , to an un@@ expectedly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say about playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things out , get up to life .
perfect job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
perfect job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program out into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars on TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes simultaneously : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal@@ ous , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programmes that I created myself and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
perfect job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I am not only typing around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true if I say that it doesn &apos;t dream about dreaming .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land of no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
this is how you wear a high tone , deliver a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the bu@@ zz that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started to work and work and make , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ um .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the h@@ um .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the tot@@ als . I am the tot@@ um .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her m@@ um@@ my is a single employer .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ stim@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 , and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine spe@@ eded .
I didn &apos;t really love my job anymore .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sl@@ um@@ ber , doesn &apos;t give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a prer@@ oll @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ aded away from the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten you stupid writer titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you do what you do , to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no when I am aware of two things :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; valu@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ e@@ the@@ art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz is smoking , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am faint .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ vings and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of money , the titan@@ ums , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am describing with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how well functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current that comes from the lust for life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this for a firm rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as easy as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person does better than being home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the bubbles .
I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones do not want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , it doesn &apos;t need more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in there !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track why don &apos;t take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so thank@@ ful .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is going to go to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life spreads in me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things out , I &apos;m awakening you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mas will stimulate the brain and increase brain pressure .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the skull &apos;s internal pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to make them prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we took a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find it at higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in colour to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ imported them at the outlet point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler &apos;s help , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ proved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to pick pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the motor motor skills in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain extent , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkey , who picked up spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ plant@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ing .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ti@@ rel@@ essness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I be@@ g you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a false belief , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are bl@@ amed , our future is glo@@ omy and our grand , new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of extravag@@ ance I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to high net worth savers and corporations , but who are too timi@@ d to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes to produce the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , US dollars have been invested in all wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollars ring after a great deal of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
in this way , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe job@@ less , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances leading to the killing of oil .
this is my sh@@ ud@@ dering with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , ended too many --
women , foreigners , and slaves of course .
but it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the point of view of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that lights very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place by gradually under@@ mining the policy and escap@@ ing it .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ ud@@ dering with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably has decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that it star@@ ves at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are exploited , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash in their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must re @-@ unite the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well .
the theory of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve humans and people are putting their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life indul@@ ges .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; kind of utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the business area : please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one place to another , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues come from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those belonging to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time Liber@@ ian , in whom it prefers privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liberal Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely chaotic .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not working , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I dare to say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the nin@@ eteenth century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly skep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to repro@@ ach China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many people are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say good bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the constant denial that a massive extermination line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this denial --
unfortunately , within the Euro zone , within the Euro Group , the powers within the euro@@ zone have continued to den@@ ounce the denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the change comes , it will pass ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister or a minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such stra@@ ined situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I thought there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , it seems to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the self @-@ released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ line and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ cs , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , it has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence in order to prohi@@ bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the middle size , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t enth@@ use .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon prints out things for nothing , do you use it correctly ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , what parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the liter@@ al sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
rather than holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , i.e. the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says that it should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
the least you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like a multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the items together again to make a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help break up a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show such as &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to steer our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technique demo .
I have taken some decisions in my life so far , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
