<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA have heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed down literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has been investigating breaches and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Senate, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous people they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been claiming years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to crack.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and making cracks, that could also be done by his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly procured his telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email, financial and banking information, his credit information, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack of alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has more condemns than all US governments in front of him." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work at stake, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been available, as a crack had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed further by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to kill offences. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the nearest environmentalist, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the greatest piece of history of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the resident Law Firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and attorneys go to firms like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mail box companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax havens are being used by a few of them to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people all over the world seem to be very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these exposures to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, need less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator retired as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked the fact that all except one lawyer, our investigator, made suggestions on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took care of us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very cloudy as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is here to lag behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are campaigning to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a postage sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where sleepest thou tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What will I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "oh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I rock up there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, slept on tiptoes to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art which he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view point.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moved out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how to make something. our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people are posting public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room that doors are closed when a visit is over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your corresponding mobile phone to your left-wing neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you now feel -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please share on Twitter that he is channeling for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name; if he had told us where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can truly capture very well-developed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests submitted their assessments before they presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation originates in similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "" "Great art works in your home! I'm doing vacation with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can design be created to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when things are not going smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I was involved in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know a real one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books to pass.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge of extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will fail.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this concept, I wondered:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it" "" "the rental industry" "" "is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there resident would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub tour quarter of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents now. students who were looking for a place of residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">The hospitality was already warm.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most of them don't know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to oust myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my head cover the Hijab.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceives you fully understands and yet loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and, like all the good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "breaking news" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do such things?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorists..." "in the name of Islam..." "Eastern origin..." "... jihadist..." "smashed Makkah!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and begin postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "" Be careful, "" "" "" "" Abide in well lit areas, "" "" "" "" Do not be sampled. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warning sounded:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims in the open and smashed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"" "" "" "because the people who attacked this land have attacked our land." ""</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have pushed the anger of the people to the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love asking.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually hear people say," "" "There is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question is: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will perhaps keep a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerant towards people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">As first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family, so that the extremists of the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">"" "" "" "if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque." ""</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology in their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you take a look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised to find a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam remarked the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of true change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you submit to Testindividuals messages that have a negative report on Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood against Muslims flowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collective guilt is not just about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented in the dental department, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has my brother made such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had visited Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we rode in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw was stopping me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregations were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that mean: we are better than ours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say you have a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, working in a posh mind factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't fool yourself. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did the largest ever study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it's efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tail starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying machines, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one function.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the most mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudes, no further actuation or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, very much happens in the inner life, so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the tail switch. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right, if everyone looks at me is low, so I show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in self-sufficiency, this machine is here, the OmniCopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of them can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When assembling them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If anything goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half of them unfit.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe press, on the other hand, wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us is the wages in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolve around each other in a very far away galaxy, so that they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit more brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the whole universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is here -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courteous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which arise through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition capacity enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was started for a last test run to solve some minor problems with persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes explored through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector, too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In order to illustrate the theory of relativity, teachers often lead a truly albernistic dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ludicrous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and striped at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">That's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For instance, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been occupied for very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same pair with an additional key change. this sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the All and hear the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own night-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo-Project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo sees them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the saurian bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos's rustling and circus.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just doing what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life profoundly, to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" "" "estimates" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "guess, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swore to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say about playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things out, get up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program out into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars on TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes simultaneously: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandalous, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my series runs one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programmes that I created myself and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are running a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I am not only typing around on the computer and imaginative, and it is true if I say that it doesn't dream about dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land of nothingness.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is how you wear a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, arduous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the buzz that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started to work and work and make, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzzing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the buzzing is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive other than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totals. I am the totum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mummy is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda-country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3, and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine speeded.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't really love my job anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not slumber, doesn't give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preroll-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly faded away from the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hasten you stupid writer titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you do what you do, to be a teacher, to be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no when I am aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "valuing."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "sweetheart" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz is smoking, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am faint.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax cravings and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl leaves in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of money, the titanums, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I am describing with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how well functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "I do this for a firm rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic." ""</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person does better than being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly rigid, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones do not want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, it doesn't need more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in there!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="778">I'm sorry that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who is going to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the luckier I and my children are.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the most well known, the "deep brain stimulation." thereby an electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain-brain traumas will stimulate the brain and increase brain pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the skull's internal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to make them prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We took a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find it at higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in colour to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-imported them at the outlet point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimport these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimproved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to pick pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor motor skills in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain extent, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkey, who picked up spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mating.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable tirelessness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clarified as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs carried out in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a false belief, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are blamed, our future is gloomy and our grand, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of extravagance I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to high net worth savers and corporations, but who are too timid to invest there where it would be productive and incomes to produce the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, US dollars have been invested in all wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US Dollars ring after a great deal of money, until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">In this way, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe jobless, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances leading to the killing of oil.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my shuddering with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and slaves of course.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the athenian democracy based on these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The point of view of the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place by gradually undermining the policy and escaping it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power has migrated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shuddering with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that so sustainably has decimated the animals from which it feeds, that it starves at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has cannibalised politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are exploited, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash in their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wasting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we must re-unite the policies and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to redesign the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "appear like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie similar to that in "matrix," in which machines serve humans and people are putting their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life indulges.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" kind of utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business area: please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one place to another, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues come from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those belonging to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it "the cosmos," into units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">That is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time Liberian, in whom it prefers privileged individuals, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and keynesians, global keynesians.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a liberal Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not working, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I dare to say this provocatively, China today resembles the England of the nineteenth century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To reproach China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say good bye to the complacency and the constant denial that a massive extermination line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, within the Euro zone, within the Euro Group, the powers within the eurozone have continued to denounce the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the change comes, it will pass abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or a minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such strained situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought there was an honest interest on the lenders' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that were running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, it seems to be pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the self-released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairline and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technics, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence in order to prohibit" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the middle size, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't enthuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon prints out things for nothing, do you use it correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, what parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the literal sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like a multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a branch, you put the items together again to make a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help break up a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show such as "House of Cards," was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas, then when they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to steer our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have taken some decisions in my life so far, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much wiser than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball gets smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
