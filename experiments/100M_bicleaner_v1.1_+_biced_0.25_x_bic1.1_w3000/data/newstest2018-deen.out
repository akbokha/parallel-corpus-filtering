Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers farm the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if land tickets are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date , yet very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them to current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of distribution of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called arch@@ ery leaves , were incorporated into the large overview map .
these were made according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Comp@@ ensation Agreement ( 18@@ 10 @-@ 18@@ 64 ) and the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally removed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : they were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a region @-@ wide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph advanced the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bay@@ erische mess@@ aging administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exposure sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erischer Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Early / Today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most impressive example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today lies Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand written numbered fle@@ ets from the so @-@ called &quot; original photograph , &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els now no longer occupy farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area distingu@@ ishes itself north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the October Festival in 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the document of the original position , in the area of present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen it is not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or on the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ asylum @-@ asylum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 seats were expanded .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in Haar in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany , has been there since 2006 .
young people will meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost is located west , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children &apos;s house was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum system , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
one big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn pedi@@ gree is carried out .
with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and racial attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special care when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to prosec@@ ute discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to issue the warnings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as racial abuse against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will be stopped by 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring money or leave relatives knowing they are traveling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that would obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in the opinion of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher pasture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a success @-@ project and will be continued next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the pi@@ voting square of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first glimp@@ sed into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals provided and accommod@@ ates holiday guests in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land care for a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the duties of his parents and engaged them without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not conduct any bio @-@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commun@@ e recognised the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the company &apos;s leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the planting of the plots could be extended quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and concerned about how they carry on their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open @-@ air area is thus 40 hectares that can not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted by leaders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmer remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers or farm workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here we produce best food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape conservation directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of f@@ ences .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the fen@@ cing area must not be tractor @-@ efficient ( slope climb over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build close to 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fishing tackle project 2018 .
the maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller gr@@ asp@@ ed not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have liked him if he had done it .
but he assumed its meaning , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ itated , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete story about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your arms , / your afflicted masses who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be seen better on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not appeal to anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lim@@ bau@@ gh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is rather unusual here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative deed was to see her as she was seen from exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred , which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ tier@@ - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 metre track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
her surrender was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that brought E@@ ili@@ d@@ h quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner competing for the fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this road and last year he set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was to be observed after a great season that included victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain said that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my address as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this back @-@ up support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critics concerning Facebook : do not s@@ wir@@ l around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he le@@ aped upon the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his sha@@ dless head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid for by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who whi@@ p the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue , they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous years if you have done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles , or to arrest prot@@ esters or to silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mile@@ stones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it shouldn &apos;t be that hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers was multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters reflected in his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , were overwhel@@ med by his position , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club held the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open in East Lo@@ thi@@ an .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he established that place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

reduced lung cancer rates due to passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of the study , Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in Vill@@ ner Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly ham@@ pers the construction work , is a big problem for the contractor St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off screens is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gold R@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the stolen Kn@@ ol@@ le is picked and swal@@ lowed with eager , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she doesn &apos;t have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in an empty space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare glimpse into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public raising in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tents , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no for@@ eigner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has a valued US $ 78 billion worth of resources .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the po@@ et@@ ans who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy are threatening these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &apos;s were considered genocide in accordance with the Asia Commission of Human Rights .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ der Every@@ thing &quot; is stated in a report by the 2016 Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e , which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week events happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring about an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it cost the native of Papua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - its market . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts have broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the shocked children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ a Y@@ eim@@ o , was beaten so severely that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young women , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting arches and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ it@@ ating in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to hur@@ l stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says TI@@ ME in an official document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of imminent danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ am still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bore a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the State Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the State Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the kill@@ ings took place until the next day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks later , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto was re@@ treating when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 victims of war in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims as gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother , Y@@ ac@@ obus , repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after having buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus , was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village inhabitants prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to account for and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the State by provo@@ king spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders originate from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native islands and the new migrants have grown , and since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport in greater numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Board of Directors .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , international media coverage restrictions remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given a rare permit to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa den@@ ying and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but anonym@@ ously .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the people of Papua have probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ho@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is inci@@ dently called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units cleared the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and covering the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play only two sets of wins for this sport , but was spar@@ se not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also very cher@@ ished Five @-@ Pack classic remain the traditional score .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our membership has not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to write the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings prohibited items to the aircraft , finds out a pol@@ l
a survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally bore forbidden blades or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone mistakenly with guns , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people , conducted by a Jet Charter Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers around the country to find out how many ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry out smu@@ g@@ gling goods through security , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the majority of the items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k willingly shares with the vast number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far failed that some of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed a different , less splendid figure for the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly assessment : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , including mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem so far .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models will be assembled - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to mus@@ k , 1800 Reserv@@ ations per day are added .
if you order a Model 3 today , you may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt goes back to reducing emissions because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that ran for countries on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay meeting a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection legislation for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden turn of Wednesday is the latest legal re@@ payment for the P@@ ru@@ ite regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule from the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his about @-@ face in o@@ zone standards simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet dead@@ lines for execution and then wait to be prosec@@ uted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set an appointment for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EP@@ O statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is aimed at dela@@ ying the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the Senate has not yet set the measure to vote .
the New York General Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our claims - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is generated when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescu@@ ing and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ arc a concern .
Walter Martin@@ i emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in 12@@ 67 : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ eng@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the wor@@ ding of the document cent@@ red on the Tum@@ linger hill outside the former parish church as well as a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way around .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from around 1600 confirm this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval Church Law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ eath this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the largest of them fell to Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ arion church was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower could be seen .
during the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortun@@ es , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with lectures by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s local leader speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
for the closing of the seren@@ ade there is a trunk in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tumours and radio schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines check
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim cor@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Gover@@ nor Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the boundary of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again approved the wind concentrations zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit issued by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it impossible to obtain permission to construct wind turbines on this site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been dealt with since last week in the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
however , they do not lead to the procedure being stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reasoning of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accidents
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the road was closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers who offers their own city away from the usual supermarket product .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the local area .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
as a result , the business association and the city enter another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established well @-@ appointed Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre at shopping from the view .
in the end everybody would have to help li@@ ven up the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ ped out , had said king in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day - five Thurin@@ gian cities - took part for the first time .
beside Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her buying behaviour directly .

Tr@@ ump put pressure on trans@@ liter@@ ation of telephone calls Mexico due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called in a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president den@@ ounced him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and wa@@ ved to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ oured to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with rif@@ les to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a pin@@ point suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the passengers flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
luckily , this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is cast , almost all of the audience che@@ ered very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really unbelievable that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see her in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; says Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the delivery .
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life long civil right .
for him , the exhibition serves as a dramatic appeal for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation unless we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician laid down a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , citizens rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for the black inhabitants of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer elections .
about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , according to FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; it was an election right massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then this will happen to you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual presentation of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a sort of profound racism , of which many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ by Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the play begins with Mal@@ com , the tester cries and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos; g@@ lit@@ tering praise &apos; St@@ range Fruit &apos; .
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ ses .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as though he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ching rope away and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience comes together with the actors for dinner .
a white pair from Atlanta is brief@@ ed at a table about the delivery with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds Broo@@ ks court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a certain sense inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ floor setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stan@@ e &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert for himself , five years later , there was a great che@@ er in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is happy to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : usually in a stone belt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
a lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
a lot : I graduated from high school .
and then a civil engineer &apos;s degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it really is on the spot , at the focal point .
and was it like that ?
a lot : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement homes to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from studying civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a fu@@ gi@@ tive or a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with them individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce other 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts reported by the Director General John Fall@@ on in the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , following an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and announced an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ le@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had launched this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack on the country , since the US forces pushed the Taliban down from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to complaints around
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that States are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states acc@@ eded the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ditions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , announced the intention of EPA to assess the o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colum@@ bian district , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to bring back a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump will boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the reco@@ il of the Democrats and nature conserv@@ atives concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and can enhance breathing symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common areas want common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a joint space in the future retirement residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing property is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take a while until the area belonging to the church community has been owned by the church , there is now no planning permission for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface of 70 square metres for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council flo@@ ats to view such a common room not as a meeting place just for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ oration @-@ friendly living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget is sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common space would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal envis@@ ages in order to signal the investor , that in this respect , one does not want to throw a b@@ ang between the legs , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as pul@@ sed roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more cost @-@ efficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unnecessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be this added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many buildings with which one does not move so well , but now you lean towards the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter value that is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ g &apos;s motion to split the proposed amend@@ ment takes three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cyclists are hur@@ led on the road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder stepped onto the road , he obviously did not regard the counter @-@ traffic .
he joined a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
the FC Bayern also travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel managers at the German football record champion Bavarian Munich are getting bigger and bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the mer@@ cen@@ aries Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the last six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was not good at last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the information needs of many visitors , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he unites nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired would be St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ sel and Si@@ eber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Ticket to Ride will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ board , viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is considerably farther away .
in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to at the end point down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ plane - are positioned exactly in the distance and y@@ ard@@ stick of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distance of the sun measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko will meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to be in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council wei@@ ght@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
as the couple posed for photos Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas observed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose up for a bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound dé@@ but this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their athle@@ tic title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he &apos;s thinking the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after punc@@ tures
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the car sm@@ iled to the right into the slope , where it was over@@ loaded and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic could be passed by the left driving lane at the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ dimensional chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season of the season , with the result , too , if there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf def@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free kick doesn &apos;t want to catch the run@@ es anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will be on line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience gained in the supply chain than with the four @-@ chain band .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford so many play@@ errors in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ successful start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight gaming days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can almost start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against one of the bone ascen@@ sion favor@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fort@@ una &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner defender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the evaluation of the age after the Swedish Migration Committee ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) critic@@ ised the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or earlier , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency indicated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years old or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Traffic and Transport department at the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three arm@@ oured bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a border for@@ tification , which is also used as an operating system .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ verti@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge @-@ caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the works , the local residents were informed about the project by hand leaflets .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished at first .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the omni@@ bus in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is single @-@ lane regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the three bridge repairs is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ asing protest with German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that is peaceful on that day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell is invited to vote for &quot; great campaign battles . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land make the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on the ground for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ Americans , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there to offer .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano @-@ Ei@@ fel is reported to have made an effort to make such an event and get the envelope .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf visited Dau@@ n initially , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ dell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidates to speak for the Par@@ liam@@ entary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officers had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is there in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have scored solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov &apos;s Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo part of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach stands for the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; unites itself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating total work of art .
this essence of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was their &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I have been reading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was especially ri@@ dden by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but during school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ary and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially to the public they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic govern@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as evident excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been caught in gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the time to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needed to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning ceremony for soldiers trun@@ cated in Mali
during a funeral service in the North @-@ H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ aar , around 1000 people of the two were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained reason for the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expert in their field &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann from northern h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali &apos;s West African Republic .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er &apos;s general inspec@@ tor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon sack@@ ed li@@ lies , and the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen designated the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deeply decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann has built the air operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , no one would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , doesn &apos;t want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish King &apos;s King is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , so she continued to write .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also took the title of Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper .
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not regard himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the editor of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , became acquainted with Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
while his later wife always flew to the people &apos;s sympathy , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and didn &apos;t feel ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to re @-@ election rapidly
CD@@ U and F@@ DP facing a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to res@@ ign , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
in the past , the surprising resignation of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP in Lower Saxony caused the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to fall into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to take it up .
this means that CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l holds it indispensable , however , that the Land@@ tag decides to resolve its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag grants the Prime Minister the confidence and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ v@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called herself a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens urged the dissi@@ dent legis@@ lators to return their Parliament &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that she has immediate effect on her land spouse , which she has received from the green land list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substantial differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ wins to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports the decision of Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the state parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their van@@ ishing vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests against the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ wins into the CD@@ U .
the head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 State election with personal career gifts .
at that time , the CD@@ U was strongest in the SPD in front of the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information about the affected Eg@@ gs @-@ Char@@ ges .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically impossible .
does Al@@ di now adopt the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been switched off without delay and since becoming known , Germany has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transport @-@ friendly and harmless to health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the residual fat content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
as far as knowledge is concerned , the production plants have no immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the alleged il@@ lic@@ it practices of service providers .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the emergency .
is it missing only at the staff or at the conclu@@ sive back@@ war@@ dness ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
precisely for this reason , consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular Alar@@ ma Universal really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to use only safe and market@@ able foods .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly judged .
due to the frau@@ dul@@ ent means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this has to work consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all responsible authorities that the facts will be solved spe@@ edi@@ ly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football match N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) in order to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners reloc@@ ated their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch used originally in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ ner continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales amount for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a $ 60 million fine ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors will be identified and such maneu@@ vers for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more alert , trying to avoid any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not competent to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated revenues of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair , because one can have different routes or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years , chocolate has produced Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
on request from the news agency s@@ da , Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current plans , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate tablets of 14 grams each year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising impact : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss will not want to give away how many applicants are available for the new tender .
but Swiss manufacturers only come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y hopes to renew the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for comment .
chocolate tablets distri@@ butes Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers will be indul@@ ged with goo@@ dies from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the business class nas@@ al passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is running out .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ us ( it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by shifting to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now novels , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another mad @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ spoken impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ lip of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy is now like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of inci@@ dental ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ fight icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are du@@ bbed by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ire Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited down to a lower length , could better deliver its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to the food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rou@@ man@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own more recent history and with thei@@ rs .
hit drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police attacked the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officers ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore presum@@ ed to be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are charged with organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor has been investigating Con@@ stance against organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
this was the reason why the big use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang &apos;s account .
fashion lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could result in asylum cases and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partially serious wrong decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , 10 million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately cared for , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from 1921 was found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data input can slow return processes significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on sufficient numbers of people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such wrong orders led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is to say in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun sending back refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is performing such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the paper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach .
if a migrants are travelling to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of arrival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with young children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states , too , would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations , shared 50 litres of blood in the meantime .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s great how our body is designed and we pay respects to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Head of Staff of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn maker reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 spin @-@ offs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently the change to the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded 50 donated blood donations each year .
half as many are book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter played 500 milli@@ litres of their li@@ fes@@ pan ten times each .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members pursuing a rise in this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to re@@ strain the inflation which was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package published a year ago after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will call for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion in ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households remains bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to not change after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened rising expectations for interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening first gets worse before it gets improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ comes break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the decline of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in proportion to their target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline of Swa@@ p payments , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive as the credi@@ tors want to lou@@ dly search for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take place , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is expected to dedic@@ ate 10,000 people to the disputed HIV drug
in September , patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS UK announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by some 86 percent , is now supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK Chef Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive factor . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means taking just enough medications in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family physician may also opt @-@ in for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuous progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people , is able to alter the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and tent@@ ative implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this study brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now important that this study will be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to a step closer to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living in great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ woman with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it look longer .
in the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan explains , from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obj@@ ec@@ tified so that when you move the door very easily , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument because of one of the biggest real estate imperial estates of Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to development areas , the Gold Coast and Mt @-@ Bul@@ ler apartments as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - owns about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it .
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court hearing took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business , including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early affair submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides .
wife De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , even though he was a former AF@@ L member and after a 2015 biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , he was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote .
s@@ ling@@ backs of new Chief of Staff are planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House he wanted to fix : poor information that got into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television extends decades - and now that he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair report , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners there , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter habit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we others do not know - that tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets have contained more explosive without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his co @-@ workers managed it a few times to prevent anger from him , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented it from causing Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Politi@@ co - concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump , like a volcano , can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens out where they come from .
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously had a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals received post from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will wor@@ sen and hope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police across Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals naturally are not known , critics from the population are hoping and wor@@ shipping .
on Friday Euro@@ pol reported on the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar .
the experience had shown that many fle@@ ets were hiding from holiday destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ plan has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times have been viewed .
36 of the online hym@@ ns could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire range &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are back with a number of def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess travellers on the war foot , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the congregation to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought along horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had only been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council needs to be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , have been moved and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am living on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travellers , only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Soli@@ hull said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and we work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move forward as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible have an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the former ambience of the Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collecting shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ challenged at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction waste containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are undertaken .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , says Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas coinci@@ de with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inter@@ mediate Inves@@ tig@@ ates Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee ad@@ joined the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N reported that there were already the first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump election campaign team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus of the investigations is to support several men acting in the election campaign as an advisor of the Republi@@ cans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more comfor@@ ting and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved to the center and accused the accus@@ ation of whether the president may have obstruc@@ ted justice in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called defend@@ ants .
they are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite people to take an oath under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his head @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also involved in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the introduction showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerate the work of the Special Off@@ er in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey had said three times that he would not be det@@ ained against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in this regard , it continued to be stated in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ra@@ cket , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him to set up an investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Special Off@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike a separate promot@@ er of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday after which the Special Off@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ice @-@ mountain drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has settled down from the ice shelf .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the giant Kol@@ oss , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and probably will take two or three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
but all in all , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C be@@ zel .
the ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and periodi@@ cally breaks away .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ horn is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ ages was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete shelf life is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a lesser extent , the British research project writes on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C be@@ zel is the fourth biggest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
it regularly breaks out there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal since the record began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not lead to the fall of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , many king@@ fish@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ integrated in recent decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the polar area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated by some three degrees and is counting on the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants home ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to withdraw from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the chal@@ k day saw 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 cler@@ ks and function@@ aries work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have finished their first day of work .
the teaching positions of the circle seem to be very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be posted for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers and powers of general management are sought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , outline concrete measures for trans@@ verse star@@ ters and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this involves a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .
it is high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he recently took care of a stub@@ born surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration should seek a ho@@ ur@@ ly tari@@ ff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better to employees and officials when it actually looks at the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are now exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established in which employees were concerned with the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to extensive alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess the alle@@ gations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that its cre@@ ws take rubber ding@@ h@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting had allegedly been held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize @-@ winner organisation is doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens over the course of this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
recei@@ pts and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner Exter@@ ior Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a view point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers have been announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shr@@ u@@ bs brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best site - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sports
do sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium by wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports have long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
these have also recognized the first federal government agencies that are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that several clubs will rise on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend the FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must be particularly concerned with the 14 to 30 @-@ year olds that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs attempted to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian .
with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more active online in these markets online than to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ hip to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the event of e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup are challenged at competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the pros compete against each other .
and e @-@ sports is part of the official program at the 2022 World Cup .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ o also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are internationally on the move , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales will be at 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants are writing .
many countries are already on the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition supplier Uni@@ cr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a lot happening in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports division .
&quot; in Europe , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to the fact that everything remains as it was always in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide by Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was convic@@ ted for two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the death of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my son was my best friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret absolutely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I do not har@@ ass the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I surround him with everything . I try to be there for eternity with us , in spite of all my pain , to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case referred to national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; get up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter drew attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the event by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter , who was convic@@ ted of murder by her British co @-@ owner in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
it &apos;s no coincidence that Joshua Kim@@ bin was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup .
the FC Bayern di@@ gests a great season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not har@@ med .
something was different at its place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , there was of course no Philipp Los@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made the split in his arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as Bavaria captain .
good , the stall could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character from the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had come out of the holidays , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays , but he .
sugar l is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot , which you want to keep in a whi@@ m .
so those who have been chosen to inher@@ it the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ ura confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
right back , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and Kim@@ i appeared in this starting formation as the one who can also take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal there@@ with not to over@@ play his missing gym ( barely til@@ ted ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out of the accompli@@ sh@@ ments of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only conditional ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le so that they do not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ ich , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to successfully compete in the game structure a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ts , one saw afterwards the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good @-@ bye to his new fellow players after a few crisp statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more .
Al@@ aba motivated O@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known football player was announced shortly before the game via Twitter and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavarian legi@@ on@@ ary is quasi club colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and be@@ fie@@ dert with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ ets of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions @-@ League Win@@ ner should be a special motivation .
perhaps our ladies might also need the famous Bav@@ arians Dus@@ el .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
it often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ En@@ quiry on a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ aming the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; bis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priorities list .
the Ministry hopes for a planning process this year , until 2021 is expected to be construction law .
the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung , Trier , also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the aim is to put the distance in operation in December 2020 , says minist@@ erial spokesperson Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce and Industry ) seeks to create a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in the wine of Wis@@ sing in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports which have been sag@@ ging for the past ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the Chamber of Commerce also pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is envis@@ aged for the passed master test and 2500 euros if graduates start independently within ten years after master training .
however , the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
to date , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce is calling for more jobs to be issued to external offices .
CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and more than 20 million euros in 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a country &apos;s concept as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
in addition , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared the field due to in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an adverse reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said it would be offering to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ted by diesel engines are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost for autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of neglec@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , Volkswagen were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s earnings .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who take the Is@@ ar again on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a mil@@ ler mountain .
the start of a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen ze@@ al as a wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally responsible behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and Lau@@ ghter Against the Sor@@ row
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ograph@@ ers , the n@@ oses of his characters are his hall@@ mark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an continues to draw and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after touring in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters mar@@ vel in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the table , working nearly ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its cute figures continue to be widely used worldwide .
he has been working on carto@@ ons and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack @-@ of @-@ all as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be projected onto the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened with climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , the la@@ ven@@ der is shr@@ inking for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions that cause big headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , the expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in spring has caused much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either absent or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or car@@ tels , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest period from violence , and while the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and inspiration for Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on drugs related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama hat .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers are rarely brought to trial by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are bl@@ aming everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez had left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated by &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but there is practically nothing to say about Val@@ dez as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people on the street are shot every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are bigger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti @-@ trust fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , presum@@ ed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing an intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for dish@@ on@@ est and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Defense of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she was leading .
he admitted willingly that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always keep his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now they ask , Was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like it if you deal with her women , her children , her clean business , her insi@@ di@@ ous run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the documentary Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has looked at three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expenditure concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in town : that the restaurant is a favorite pub for drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were bl@@ amed for high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers would have considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador admi@@ ral disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing down on pav@@ ements and buildings in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press . &quot;
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez fled to Washington and tried to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re @-@ classified by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who go back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug trade frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to h@@ um .
19 confirmed dead were left behind a series of fights with band riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kar@@ tell messages in the region .
from the edge of the border , they published the news on the ri@@ odo@@ ce site via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ eded nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez made a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well preserved state has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth l@@ umps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was asleep , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rier . &quot;
researchers have discovered that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bling a changing tank , were probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed itself to better interfere with its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours in search of it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs have been hun@@ ted by eating din@@ osau@@ rs with enough pressure that evolution fav@@ oured the mas@@ king of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ ors behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors have been of the county time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and was driven into the sea , where he sank down to the sea bed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ ted sc@@ aly skin but remains preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time was a time when huge geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
to this belongs the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hanging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ ters still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that bear the skull of the animal .
its right front foot rests on its side , its five fingers are sp@@ la@@ yed upward .
I can count the scales at his sole . &apos;
thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injuries
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long st@@ aus and g@@ aff@@ s .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first information of the police , around 5@@ pm between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm barely thirty vehicles , including probably trucks , crashed into each other .
there were initially no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large collection of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a back@@ war@@ k of approximately ten kilometres was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there were also massive disabilities on the opposite track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ s .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing susp@@ icious is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ett@@ led or tear@@ ing the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
it is easy to confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus vali@@ dates the ticket .
a test run is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the train without any conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
one must also have the app of the train that DB navig@@ ator bought , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants will get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
if the train companion arrives at PLA@@ Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can sleep on , continue working , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to relax without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train staff , you simply check in the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their journey times more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB long @-@ haul marketing director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who go by train know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because of@@ ten@@ times one has , in any case , one of the co @-@ travellers not all the documents that one needs to de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and taking the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken up to its core on August 9 , 2014 .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis has been sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police strip and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman &apos;s gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell at her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would ride to F@@ erg@@ uson next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting at 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and fill the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell drove to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a floral dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state many times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ uson because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally doesn &apos;t experience any bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell hit Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came up Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death row mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ ry closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team in the years following Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah , but a community that is coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets documents show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed as she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really uph@@ eld by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ vely type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which Fer@@ rell has chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no accident , although it was on the front line because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the communications cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ uson in F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except for our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss via bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 split the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to say that the issue is cold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schu@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ m ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery more customers in the city , of which the other businesses profit , the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm @-@ wives very gladly again and again .
we discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us too .
we would like to see that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent will be added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the art of shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops stand empty here - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are hired only by larger firms in a shopping mall , as the tenants there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a pity that special stores don &apos;t exist anymore and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where does the farmers market hall look like during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gallery already manage to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg earlier ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly identical - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after serving as secret diplom@@ ati@@ cal reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( resem@@ b@@ lance to resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , extracted from man@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , if also some intellectual comment not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly spoke about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits ou@@ trage@@ ously on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette stu@@ bs and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal relatives who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s illustrated &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future where the president would convert the Over@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump brings a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts he should address .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing concluded with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Comic @-@ No@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she emerges with a hands @-@ on phone in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary tanks , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they are cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ut@@ ates from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ chari@@ sts , who meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also purpos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , with which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg off the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the University of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford searched for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for his alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued on Monday for the alleged involvement in the County Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a joint warning system , published by the Chicago Police Department , states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
he has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ garbage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they are now being assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal responsibility examined by the relevant authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are willing to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that trucks and war@@ locks were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the backdrop of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable is updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ installing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause anxiety for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the recommendation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the inquiry because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ i &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing committee .
speaking with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing scandal by WA@@ DA by the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that it could not go beyond any health impair@@ ment , it said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ ato @-@ containing anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees &quot; commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel gained in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most gri@@ ev@@ ances and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee wrote a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
how G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent company lets you send tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; Sur@@ veys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company finds its employees poorly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously covered by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ - more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law@@ suits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to ap@@ point ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as service , and debit the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors , who supported both start @-@ ups .
scent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just ins@@ ets .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow staff , ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you concerned about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is gaining new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players are talking on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas .
some have moved out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three U@@ C@@ LA training sessions are scheduled to start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood did practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing arrangements for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they went further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared with foot@@ balls leaving a protective net behind a goal post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that the people rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake testim@@ oni@@ als from third parties and then display their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may show results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan for which social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts examination will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual reviews are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test its feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy home in the Hav@@ en River Valley and is now an inspiration for a novel novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke ; for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
alas , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is s@@ mitten so with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome break &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that represent what they had : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go their course ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a wider basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are joined together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , which the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell of the 18th century , who staged his own funeral , filled a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lords seemed quite dum@@ b , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his mission in the castle
he spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a comic book about E@@ lä@@ ser@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle coated in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , it is said to be the highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , it is in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will pay a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
this week too .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office .
the five vice @-@ pres@@ idents and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations .
thus , the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS was the number one .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the pulling @-@ off of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , this week has been negotiating in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan declared the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ iry in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are concerns on the general staff because of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ case ban for soldiers , the newspaper wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the army and security forces continue to work in the army and security forces .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan left more than 73@@ 95 state ser@@ ge@@ ants per decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as the gu@@ ardian of the secular state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed back the military &apos;s power step by step , not least relying on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not let NATO get cold .
anyway , in the alliance , after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the Turkish army &apos;s readiness to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington Chang@@ ing Green Card Rules
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he proposes to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate track for race track shuttle
over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of the race track utt@@ les - now it &apos;s supposed to go very quickly .
before the end of the year , it is said to be built on the long route , on which the tourist train leaves .
in order to secure the future of the vehicle in the long term , construction work will start in the course of this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabili@@ tate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained District Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he reduced the cost of repairs to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country sur@@ vey@@ ed 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle should be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia rail as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection , particularly popular among tourists , between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to see whether the track is being used by sufficient numbers of people to order them again in the future .
the route is also very b@@ ang@@ ent in parts .
the ascen@@ sion of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that it will not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies are delivering a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have become robots with a silicon membrane .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed celeb@@ ri@@ ties such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her m@@ oods over the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , be@@ wil@@ der one the most .
on its website compared to True Compan@@ ion ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
her gen@@ esis and her increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R attracts their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the fr@@ inge can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not weird or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing at a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ polymer proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , im@@ it@@ ating the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are false slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
pumps l@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , newspapers were given advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump choosing relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bags .
less noted is the power of tr@@ umps , families to bring together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House every one she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same page .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is obvious to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky possibility that one day his kit@@ tens will no longer be thrown off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; in the right wing which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness when compared to its standards .
today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed one as very mild criminal off@@ enses .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals turn away to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the c@@ lich@@ é music con@@ veys this in a curious way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of tall buildings are getting old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor lady in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar pist@@ achi@@ o with chest pain released from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts at his wrist , which he reported to the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
he was sentenced to death because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , dropping it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say she is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosecutor announced that she was acqu@@ itted by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal may be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ line gli@@ ders from F@@ agit@@ tari@@ us and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the cheerful sound brought a musical entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken erhof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to be incu@@ b@@ ated by its chickens .
instead of a chicken farm a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken sh@@ at@@ tered , the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that , classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studio .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ lers who carried cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ leiter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angel@@ ika Mor@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished everyone four @-@ part @-@ wat@@ ler that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a thank @-@ word to colleagues , former head of the school , Michael Müller , who always comes up with teaching bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ ber was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher pointed out .
after two years of teaching , she left her school very reluct@@ antly , because it was a really great time .
finally , she was able to rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler .
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
with the children , great joy broke out among the children .
eight original owners have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced , quoted on TV .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally w@@ ading people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of free camping and lay down substantial fin@@ es for anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected must now know
how accurate does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of Euro 5 cars and some Euro 6 emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the manufacturers announced a swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler has advised to write to each person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fitting have to take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fit itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises waiting .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would sub@@ tract , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions threaten .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older dies@@ els .
the ACE advises to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates won &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural festival announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US president Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and take part in the award with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV shows , announced that he would not be able to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely ignore the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and this burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she would use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make it clear .
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
former price winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .

the place is already written out - suitable candidates are rare however .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder .
and the work makes him still great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as the Lower Con@@ duct Authority , the applicant must provide relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were unable to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have gathered , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are approaching .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium restoration is still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city builder .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gardening centre can react very flexibly in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the city builders have a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
if you would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to instruc@@ t the city of Has@@ lach to study as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or with a subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law .
the Municipal Building Authority supports civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , municipal property management , building yard and urban landsc@@ aping , as well as the building rights authority , including the protection of the building rights .
bike on cables suspended : South rail track closed
according to the police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines in the area of the Le@@ oben road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes well beyond a br@@ ush@@ wood empire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator could have put himself in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the costs of rail replacement transport , even further pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be caused without disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains had dropped on Friday morning , two of them were driving distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the affected person is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
when the balance reaches too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a type of tolerance promotes immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their vis@@ ors .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes a more tolerant , less inflammatory Bow@@ el &apos;s environment if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that fav@@ ours tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , but which was separately accommod@@ ated , did not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active ingredient was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice food , the number of cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us rep@@ lies rep@@ ut@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to support since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched forward .
however , he was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , giving M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ ber@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho requested three more new commitments but insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Boeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in the Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such an advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no counter@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , with growing horror , observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep failures .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxon Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal managing director and campaign manager of the Green Party Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er sigh@@ s , when on Friday afternoon the new job message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , President of the SPD ( SPD ) Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transfer of the green parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ wins to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , was the cal@@ ming of the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ gh sli@@ d the party out smoothly .
comrades in the weeks after it lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ pp@@ elled up again .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landscape ef , lost his nim@@ bus at the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ gas affair and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the aspir@@ ations of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden by comrades in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from afar .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen combined their own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected to the Parliament on the list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U representative fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy funds for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate his old @-@ year @-@ old house can receive support from the country in the near future .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed on Wednesday in feelings .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , it has been in a sense of re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I of 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to promote the development of the interior , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe gave the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the total amount concerned amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how is a re@@ development area developed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , examine where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area to san@@ e .
if necessary , the regional boundaries may also be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the survey would only be conducted once , within the framework of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment programme to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , so that in the coming year it can begin with the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
at the same time , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary investigations .
the aim is to assess the urban situation and to decide when it will be rehabili@@ t@@ ated and to what extent .
for the respective plot there will be also a commemor@@ ative note posted in the register of the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
for this reason , questionna@@ ires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the renovation plans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing sheet , &quot; information about the size , distribution and residents of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies from the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , first warns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a san@@ itation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip in order to come home and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined forces with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built @-@ in both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
white House advertising costs tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlighted the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military that were left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was shown next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the meeting of his superi@@ ors , the deputy military commander of aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter had arrived at the South La@@ wn event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was necessary in the end .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Card and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President announced an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump took up an investigation in February when the presidential aer@@ ob@@ atic served in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event accounted for the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential Commit@@ tees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the load for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the State Department of Defense estimates for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
chron@@ icle records show the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract termination .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump had inter@@ acted with the helicopter while he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss facing challenging task
leading the second division of tennis in the second division of the Bundes@@ liga ( Bundes@@ liga ) will take place at the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC @-@ Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite after five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second division of tennis in the second Bundes@@ liga turned the point for reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to interventions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ska ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier could give his debut for blue @-@ white .
if the Fren@@ chman , who is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , does not win the League for the Bundes@@ liga , he will be playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in Liber@@ ec in the Czech Republic for his first time in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chi@@ lean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ se @-@ Cas@@ tillo won the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he was to be part of Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back into the team .
if it &apos;s enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the junior @-@ world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills up the cad@@ re .
how America can damage O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he set his signature on Wednesday night under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his H@@ ast , en@@ acting the law , &quot; the Congress contained a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ iled the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of O@@ MV are al@@ armed , which together with other European companies co @-@ funded the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea service Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one setting is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an app@@ rais@@ al of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump had to raise even the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos that reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar &apos;s killer , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over yet .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city centers of day @-@ to @-@ day centers .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the city &apos;s day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children each sat at the tables and the need is growing constantly .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ day hours are eating in the day@@ time K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ workers have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the food supplied , add salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , clean the meal , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ leg@@ ged institutions - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen colleagues are now part of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important to the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - also the task of the kitchen staff - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign spending for the city as the most economical one , says it from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are reset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 people in the educational field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , the official leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eling in the elections in the Provin@@ ces . three women are campaig@@ ning for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , elections will be handed over peac@@ efully to the next government elected by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who was staying with friends on Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but went on with her friends .
then one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the girl &apos;s mobile and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without loo@@ t , the duo escaped .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are going on .
G@@ MB concern on investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow location among managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturers Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s subsidiary G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressing concerns that funding for moderni@@ zing production lines is not going to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from General @-@ Site Manager is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
so under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , we continually review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga might regret interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not stop in its pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and becomes the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i in 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti early this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator was deliberately kno@@ cked down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 , and so on the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle , damage done by more than 200 euros .
police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to reti@@ re and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his road , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
on the passenger car , material damage was developed .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ cycli@@ st did not notice the accident at all .
the police now invites witnesses of the incident and the driver of the criminal vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cathedral spar@@ row report rati@@ fies Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ ss@@ der , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication from the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be measured in reporting about violence against dom@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee , should be conspic@@ u@@ ously aware of the &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that must be punished and prevented in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Scar@@ fa@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ oured face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the bi@@ ologist Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg cathedral spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 dom@@ es .
in the final report Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , states : &quot; in conclusion , many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ oked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ esh@@ man explains why the final report on the abuse scandal was reli@@ eved by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence exercise on protected victims of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible when a dome set didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you consider this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all .
it is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the ex@@ propri@@ ation of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of activity .
you can , at best , repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also presents an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and threw the mud on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ fig@@ s distributed and too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys to the hair or ears , he himself regre@@ t@@ ted many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time of the war , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
in comparison to what this report is about , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , there was much talk about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in connection with the report .
will George R@@ atz@@ inger be accused of any involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted the domain master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those who were affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rator in a professional manner .
how do the Spar@@ row Spar@@ row students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that just before it ... Bu@@ ben penet@@ rated or more clearly or more opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse goes , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be utter@@ ed by all co @-@ workers .
so he cannot be repro@@ ached for preventing him from being prevented or brought to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate your good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge m@@ é@@ lange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is again a mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is a clean separation : between the primary school and the secondary school of the Cathedral Spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a chor@@ us of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which child of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mal@@ treated , and suffered from them , all experienced at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the dom@@ ed dom@@ ed gym@@ nasi@@ um .
on that was , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al conditions . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have been stolen away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome of the dome , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably still knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate the situation where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 was it officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria .
the Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was burned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally worked up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus creating ear files and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also contribute to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , since the cathedral spar@@ rows played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not conc@@ ede that he was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even that must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and sweets on their own , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys don &apos;t even make a big singer and before every success , regardless of their territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
as what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ loving , deeply believing and hear@@ tless people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything even just a fly .
I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former dome @-@ cats today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and communicated to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect to which they still look at and worship them .
and please , again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just to make a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent Brother to become a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , all too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves the burden on him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who earned himself great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
