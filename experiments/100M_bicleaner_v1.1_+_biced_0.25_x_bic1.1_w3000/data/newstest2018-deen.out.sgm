<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners farm the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if land tickets are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date, yet very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them to current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of distribution of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called archery leaves, were incorporated into the large overview map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bayerisches Compensation Agreement (1810-1864) and the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally removed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: they were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a region-wide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph advanced the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bayerische messaging administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The exposure sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerischer Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the comparison" "" "Early / Today" "" "is the most impressive example of the state capital." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today lies Untersendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand written numbered fleets from the so-called "original photograph," from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels now no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area distinguishes itself north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the location of the October Festival in 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the document of the original position, in the area of present district Au-Haidhausen it is not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or on the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-asylum-asylum" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later on 500 seats were expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people will meet at the Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich Ost is located west, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "children's house was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum system, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main place" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn pedigree is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racial attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to prosecute discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities that are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue the warnings, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racial abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state will be stopped by 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring money or leave relatives knowing they are traveling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that would oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, which will contribute to further racial profiling in the opinion of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher pasture" "" "project is a success-project and will be continued next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the pivoting square of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first glimpsed into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals provided and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of the BLHV, he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot profitably manage on such steep faces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland care for a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the duties of his parents and engaged them without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct any bio-operations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the commune recognised the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the company's leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the planting of the plots could be extended quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and concerned about how they carry on their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-air area is thus 40 hectares that can not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted by leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers or farm workers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also noted:" "" "here we produce best food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape conservation directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "furthermore, the fencing area must not be tractor-efficient (slope climb over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build close to 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fishing tackle project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller grasped not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he assumed its meaning, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta imitated, "I don't want to enter a complete story about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your arms, / your afflicted masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was to be seen better on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not appeal to anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">"" "" "" "Limbaugh" "" "is rather unusual here." ""</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative deed was to see her as she was seen from exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buttier- who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 metre track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her surrender was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that brought Eilidh quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner competing for the fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir goes on this road and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was to be observed after a great season that included victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain said that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my address as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this back-up support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics concerning Facebook: do not swirl around a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped upon the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his shadless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid for by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who whip the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey carried out at more than 1,000 people, conducted by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travellers would rather disregard the rules.</seg>

<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far failed that some of the customers have already retracted their non-binding reservation.</seg>

<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has frequently recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk admits: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models will be assembled - 500,000 by 2020, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to musk, 1800 Reservations per day are added.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to greater delays, the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescuing and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters Tumarc a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">The St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in 1267: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumenglingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the document centred on the Tumlinger hill outside the former parish church as well as a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from around 1600 confirm this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval Church Law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The largest of them fell to Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarion church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower could be seen.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortunes, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite friends and sponsors of Tumarc on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of the St. Hilary Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium in Freudenstadt and with lectures by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann's local leader speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 PM.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the closing of the serenade there is a trunk in front of the graveyard.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers provide fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumours and radio schweiler.</seg>

<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A seven-tonne concrete section was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of the Traffic and Transport department at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three armoured bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning now has a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating system.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Divertio.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge-caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the works, the local residents were informed about the project by hand leaflets.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished at first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football match Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) in order to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy-rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners relocated their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich used originally in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferner continues to be deterred by excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the sales amount for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 44,4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a $60 million fine (then 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be identified and such maneuvers for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more alert, trying to avoid any attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated revenues of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups who are now adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the watering principle, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novels, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another mad-vicious Plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-spoken impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underlip of "singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy is now like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of incidental madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even to "GLOW" with his East-West-West-fight iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloire Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living in great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bankwoman with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "Erfan explains, from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is objectified so that when you move the door very easily, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "Erfan says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument because of one of the biggest real estate imperial estates of Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the De LUTIS portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the Gold Coast and Mt-Buller apartments as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the Supreme Court hearing took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business, including Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Wife De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first denim shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started West co there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, whereby Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says," "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial division." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very shy, even though he was a former AFL member and after a 2015 biography from Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin replied by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case is in front of the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our surname through the dishes," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," "" "he said, and added that he" "" "still hope for a solution." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Slingbacks of new Chief of Staff are planning to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House he wanted to fix: poor information that got into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship to television extends decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry about unfair report, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Ms. Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigners there, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that the" "" "Twitter habit" "" "was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we others do not know - that trumps Tweets have contained more explosive without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed it a few times to prevent anger from him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from causing Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he stiffens out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously had a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof during the former ambience of the Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also receipts from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collecting shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not unchallenged at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels, managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bath tubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1465">"" "everything should become" "" "pretty bourgeois" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>

<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set itself wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has held talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause, says Scherer.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Intermediate Investigates Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee adjoined the work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "", "calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there were already the first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between the eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">"" "Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the" "" "Trump election campaign team" "" "and Moscow." ""</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigations is to support several men acting in the election campaign as an advisor of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more comforting and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump had personally moved to the center and accused the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite people to take an oath under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">"" "" "" "people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify," "" "said the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his head-in-law Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the introduction showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for apprehension for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works secretly, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures that accelerate the work of the Special Offer in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey had said three times that he would not be detained against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed in this regard, it continued to be stated in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this racket, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate committee, Trump had asked him to set up an investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the Special Offer and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike a separate promoter of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented bills on Thursday after which the Special Offer could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>

<seg id="1525">But all in all, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C bezel.</seg>
<seg id="1528">The ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and periodically breaks away.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhorn is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and breakages was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shelf life is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger, because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it does after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, the British research project writes on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C bezel is the fourth biggest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It regularly breaks out there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most widespread withdrawal since the record began," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">According to his colleague Adrian Luckman, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not lead to the fall of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, many kingfishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have been disintegrated in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the polar area of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by some three degrees and is counting on the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants home arif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU asks to withdraw from the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the chalk day saw 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 clerks and functionaries work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have finished their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions of the circle seem to be very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be posted for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers and powers of general management are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">"" "" "" "the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, outline concrete measures for transverse starters and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This involves a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He recently took care of a stubborn surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration should seek a hourly tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated cities," "" "states nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">By doing so, the CDU tries to pay better to employees and officials when it actually looks at the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are now exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established in which employees were concerned with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on social media.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting had allegedly been held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream planes.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga caters for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium by wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sports have long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal government agencies that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual soccer players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "real football must be particularly concerned with the 14 to 30-year olds that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs attempted to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent electric sportsmen under contract, one could be far more active online in these markets online than to send the Bundesligamannhip to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the event of e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the FIFA World Cup are challenged at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And e-sports is part of the official program at the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitter player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "Frobo also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes more and more an issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are internationally on the move, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales will be at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants are writing.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the international level.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez take part in the US Team NRG eSports.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message:" "" "laugh," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he worked as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After touring in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo characters marvel in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, its cute figures continue to be widely used worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on cartoons and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought conditions and insect-borne insects, the lavender is shrinking for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions that cause big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, the expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in spring has caused much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small chicade, a microbacterium that transfers the dwarf, and with very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest period from violence, and while the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and inspiration for Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drugs related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers are rarely brought to trial by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we are blaming everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez had left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated by "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to say about Valdez as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people on the street are shot every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival anti-trust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, presumed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues at the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering an intoxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for dishonest and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Defense of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He admitted willingly that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always keep his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask, Was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "you don't like it if you deal with her women, her children, her clean business, her insidious runways and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the documentary Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days earlier, it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the Governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditure concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in town: that the restaurant is a favorite pub for drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were blamed for high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Porter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador admiral disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing down on pavements and buildings in organized protests "SOS Press."</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez fled to Washington and tried to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is re-classified by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "in Mexico by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1928">"" "its incredibly well preserved state has baffled researchers who describe it as" "" "really remarkable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth lumps.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was asleep," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembling a changing tank, were probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed itself to better interfere with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the Museum engineer Mark Mitchell, who has spent more than 7,000 hours in search of it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs have been hunted by eating dinosaurs with enough pressure that evolution favoured the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predators behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been of the county time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe the dinosaur when he died, got into a river and was driven into the sea, where he sank down to the sea bed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserted scaly skin but remains preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous time was a time when huge geodes, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">To this belongs the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hanging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutters still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that bear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">Its right front foot rests on its side, its five fingers are splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. '</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles-long staus and gaffs.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first information of the police, around 5pm between the junction points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm barely thirty vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There were initially no indications of the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "it is light to moderate injuries," "" "said a police spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large collection of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, a backwark of approximately ten kilometres was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite track - through numerous Gaffs.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire department noted the characteristics of the car drivers, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive fines.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing suspicious is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and arouses an unsettled or tearing the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is easy to confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus validates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A test run is currently running on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "when the offer comes, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-haul routes in Germany," "" "said a railway spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort Check-in" "" "is the name of the train without any conductor." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">One must also have the app of the train that DB navigator bought, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you get into the train, call your ticket at" "" "My tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers then have a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants will get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train companion arrives at PLAY at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can sleep on, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to relax without ticketing through our train staff, you simply check in the DB navigator yourself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who go by train know that apart from delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes one has, in any case, one of the co-travellers not all the documents that one needs to devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, leading to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling one's own tickets and taking the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies only to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core on August 9, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after arriving in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis has been sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, because no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police strip and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, secured another policeman's gun and screamed:" "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "said Ferrell at her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and cried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would ride to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting at 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and fill the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state many times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take them away," "" "said Ferry later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally doesn't experience any blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it has all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell hit Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came up Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row mates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferry closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the Whose Streets team in the years following Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for this is how I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah, but a community that is coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, Whose Streets documents show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really upheld by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, she insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatively type of action" "", "which Ferrell has chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no accident, although it was on the front line because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the communications cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home:" "" "a mess." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a singing and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into Ferguson in Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss via bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 split the population into proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"" "" "" "it's hard to say that the issue is cold." ""</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while some say to the bit gallery:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "It would be really great" "" "(Nicole Schusten), comes from the other side:" "" "no man needs" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "" "megalm!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building a gallery more customers in the city, of which the other businesses profit, the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will conclude with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm-wives very gladly again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butcher's shop for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "Gerd Densing:" "" "if direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent will be added." ""</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops stand empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But as there is not even a weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops are hired only by larger firms in a shopping mall, as the tenants there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "it's a pity that special stores don't exist anymore and that which is left of it will probably disappear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where does the farmers market hall look like during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery comes at some point.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg have no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly identical - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison term after serving as secret diplomatical reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (resemblance to resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, extracted from maning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, if also some intellectual comment not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but openly spoke about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits outrageously on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the trash to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal relatives who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili's Kanungo's illustrated "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future where the president would convert the Overseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump brings a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he should address.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning concluded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end of "automatic dispersion, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Noelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she emerges with a hands-on phone in the hands of the United States "disciplinary tanks, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "when they are cold, they have won," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulaccharists, who meet like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), with which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees "commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel gained in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most grievances and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee wrote a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="2220">How GLINT, Convercent company lets you send tailor-made "Puls-" Surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees poorly treated or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that were previously covered by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practic- more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to appoint ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as service, and debit the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors, who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Scent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more of their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just insets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough or not at all, this can cause disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow staff, ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employees surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a sip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy home in the Haven River Valley and is now an inspiration for a novel novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years" in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empire, maps that represent what they had: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting the two families.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it will not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepper woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicon membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed celebrities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods over the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, bewilder one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website compared to True Companion roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her genesis and her increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR attracts their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the fringe can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing at a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most scrupulous aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornopolymer proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are false slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps lumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney an epitome of common sense of human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers were given advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly exert ourselves to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of trumps, families to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House every one she knows, including the republican relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is obvious to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the spooky possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be thrown off." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans are "normalized" in the right wing which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness when compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed one as very mild criminal offenses.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals turn away to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cliché music conveys this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this is to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor lady in the department store apologizing, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts at his wrist, which he reported to the prison authorities according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was sentenced to death because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, dropping it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison term of Pistorius Appell, of which they say she is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecutor announced that she was acquitted by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - suitable candidates are rare however.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes him still great fun, as he mediates in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the Administrative Community as the Lower Conduct Authority, the applicant must provide relevant conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they were unable to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2554">In terms of design, there is great leeway for a city builder.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the retiring Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the city builders have a high degree of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "in the end everything is going over my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to instruct the city of Haslach to study as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected person is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance reaches too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance promotes immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their visors.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory Bowel's environment if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that favours tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem, but which was separately accommodated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as the idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice food, the number of cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us replies reputi in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to support since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is also important to promote the development of the interior, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe gave the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total amount concerned amounted to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program" "" "Social City" "", "where the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for funding has been running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the survey would only be conducted once, within the framework of those involved in the refurbishment programme to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible, so that in the coming year it can begin with the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2693">At the same time, Pietzschmann explained that each commune must carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will again come to his senses and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse is relieved by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," announced after publication from the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>

<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" ", on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "would be measured in reporting about violence against domes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">However, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee, should be conspicuously aware of the "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal" "", "says Scarfaia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "" "we're happy to go to the church and that's a devoured face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "strikes were a very normal educational tool" "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take refuge in Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with it," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>

<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 domes.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "in conclusion, many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could be more severe.</seg>

<seg id="2908">In the interview, Heshman explains why the final report on the abuse scandal was relieved by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence exercise on protected victims of the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who became tangible when a dome set didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you consider this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The expropriation of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can, at best, reproach him, learn from it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived as" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "" "by virtually all those surveyed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also presents an excellent testimony, describes him as "warm", "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knit with chairs and threw the mud on the floor, but also gave ear-figs distributed and too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself regretted many years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time of the war, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison to what this report is about, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, this is certainly Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many people who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, there was much talk about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will George Ratzinger be accused of any involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of those who were affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Sparrow Sparrow students Ratzinger's role in terms of the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Ezemann: a questionable student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that just before it... Buben penetrated or more clearly or more opened than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse goes, Georg Ratzinger is to be uttered by all co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be reproached for preventing him from being prevented or brought to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate your good name with these disgusting crimes as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read with the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Ezemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge mélange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is a clean separation: between the primary school and the secondary school of the Cathedral Sparrows, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which child of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and maltreated, and suffered from them, all experienced at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the domed domed gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Ezemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims" "" "estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">This way, at most, the accusation remains to have been stolen away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome of the dome, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate the situation where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 was it officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Ezemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was burned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm glad that it's finally worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger's protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus creating ear files and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, he was also strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My Brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also contribute to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the cathedral sparrows played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not concede that he was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even that must be said: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and sweets on their own, the unruly boys don't even make a big singer and before every success, regardless of their territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Ezemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-loving, deeply believing and heartless people, of whom one can't imagine that he could do anything even just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former dome-cats today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspcats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and communicated to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable disrespect to which they still look at and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again clearly: all that you reproach him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust to make a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent Brother to become a media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
