28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and that the investigations are running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had gri@@ pped his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a claimed that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to connect his style with his family was to cook for us always , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , which lit bright every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the event will be asked to call the ep@@ ist@@ le of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or aff@@ i@@ xed by the outside label that has little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather sn@@ ak@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of TV with lo@@ cker@@ â de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
for white glu@@ t , she brings the question of the desire for a child : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyrami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues at the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyrami@@ ds &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled on their eve , they gal@@ lo@@ ped back home to feed in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself run with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bother to take pictures .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the scope of a small gala the Golden World Py@@ ramid .
the li@@ ke@@ able athlete does not lack awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyrami@@ ds is a long one .
he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering offspring for decades .
and so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Poli@@ cies in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s All about the Money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trading agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental principle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich are increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dy .
the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical party wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and build coal mining in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in protected areas , it wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly build up renewable energy and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ tive trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but rather protect American jobs better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger pay .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ att@@ led , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled wife has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chickens .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs took up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are tra@@ cked politically because torture or death threaten them , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , conf@@ uses , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior or ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they think .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , even fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central flats available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; privacy is missing , or if men and women are housed together , there can be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistance doctors are on strike : demands for new labor competition measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant veter@@ in@@ arians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor unions in their disputes concerning a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more labour disputes from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; to problems , leading to the rejection of the agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the Board of Directors has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official re@@ negotiations for all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour struggles that begins in early September .
the con@@ ten@@ tions led to the fact that assistant doctors in six quar@@ rel@@ ed this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assistance Center Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election for the rejection of the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assi@@ sts and medical students , with the conclusion that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced in force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow@@ ly sli@@ pp@@ ily and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly expressed his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but a sustainable cooling eff@@ lu@@ ent by Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was floo@@ d@@ lighted .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the decline was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the alle@@ gations made by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin got the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey also sh@@ ook him .
but there are economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ da@@ sti expressed it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge about the slu@@ g &apos;s rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ vot@@ al to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state of state won a claim in Ankara for sure that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow which has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this g@@ lit@@ tering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y a &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now fade .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they did not even understand the subject .
the President of Turkey has deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey ki@@ cked off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for clients outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for clients outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced the Scotland Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying now that we do not pursue any global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3@@ 000@@ th advantage at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne in a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ le , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ sier , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career sides
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey der Moderne and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved ahead of him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years for this kind of sport .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character@@ ful strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .

born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the chief executive officer and commander of the government staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state with respect to legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ es Vladimir Putin and worked as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced of this - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
but the official statement - that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president would like to direct Russian environmental policy - came across big scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - to entr@@ ust myself to a valuable post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of his time viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical exploration of the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ son out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published according to the statement of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios in a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played at the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have plu@@ gged all my heart blood for the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish landed in Ban@@ ff garden
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be a sand beach with 75 fish that were pe@@ pper@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fishes .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 be@@ vel cables .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Seminar Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents trend @-@ setting up@@ - and underground construction .
after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck located in the expansion , we had to close the gap between the north and the south .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team work towards were tiny - on each side they saw only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were tos@@ sed off to Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat departed from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging by a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has guarded these men today .
seriously injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ rator dis@@ sec@@ ts the clothes from his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
he then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife on the street .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig &apos;s favorable housing ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors should be taken into consideration much more strongly .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the coming years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; room for action &quot; at the next meeting of the Council .
but conflict is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable housing can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
however , the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann says , &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
in spite of this , as Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market has cre@@ pt in .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the experts .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how can we compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose support will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be sold @-@ out binding from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about retri@@ eving the apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
at the end of the year there are periods in the Western city .
around 1800 apartments could be retri@@ eved there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations .
this is because the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically , away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there shouldn &apos;t be more concentration of socially vulnerable in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a large majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
teen@@ age boys and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer spending their free time watching screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people out of the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV set , then on video games , and recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
it goes without saying that I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell into effect at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand over@@ loaded by the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ dness and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even include new friend@@ ships in the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ori@@ fic gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish over time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people hunt more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ age ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
all in all brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast joined the competition on Thursday and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es are touring the Swedish bar during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ al is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anist who wins a championship title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment .
she represents this success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es won the last three years of her sport , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u ett spoke of her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women &apos;s gymnas@@ tics tournaments at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although the picture insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - are tuned to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she won no more competition in the competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as she wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina made it easy by two turns , the image clou@@ ded .
floating bars and floor ur@@ ns - in which it holds the world title - guaranteed .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her end - a mere form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ol , who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their soil practi@@ sing , she kno@@ cked out kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot in a serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , were killed while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12th June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots of a hand @-@ gun , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y affair , as the aggres@@ sor didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard &apos;s police spokesman said that shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were tied up and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his elderly , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ zi@@ en@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know about during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t manage that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t let myself go on that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth is showing the sign language Ed@@ mund explains for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we give him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told him .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rain@@ falls , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to sh@@ out the emergency on Friday . it will be expected all Saturday above with more rain@@ falls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding following extreme ra@@ ins , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and is already underway to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ d@@ light system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service made it lou@@ der that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain .
a flood warning system was deployed on Friday in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite , near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann said that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ascension Par@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still b@@ umped people out of flood water in the districts of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ver on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose massi@@ vely over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high point of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the obstacles and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ver , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground was considerably su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and power failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa sent 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to flood water and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his specifications , a handful of houses on Thursday announced as being flooded , but on Friday they were not reported until now .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; out@@ lived shooting in Philadelphia
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun injuries , including the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ end@@ z shared the broad@@ caster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that it is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ age tubes for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked to various assault rif@@ les , were at the scene of the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , shells were located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di shared the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she is re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine to be part of the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls from other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ ś@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in , rounds off , makes everybody proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and he was ju@@ bil@@ ant .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world championship in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anist who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this kind of sport , but so do gymnas@@ tics classes in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily consists in private gym@@ n@@ astic clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner maintains its entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to make a more affordable and easier accessible turn training to the communities of the countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
that is an exciting time .
thank Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of Girl Power by the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s function@@ aries , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted on a choice rejected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend packages to improve the maintenance of the clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a message saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks have met with the government on the reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that happened because Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise the raise and address the concerns of assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were included to provide coverage to doctors on the strip chain .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s function@@ aries .
the BM@@ A wants a better day @-@ to @-@ day remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 assi@@ sts who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ fighting measures do not achieve anything that is little , but already pol@@ lu@@ te over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training courses , additional training courses for those who return from a professional break @-@ up , training centres , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holiday and the Ministry of Health for compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after it was advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority ( N@@ ICE ) recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority ( N@@ ICE ) recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls creating floor@@ ings .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the intake design by N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health evaluation center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture Mak@@ es electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report .
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities ignor@@ antly ignor@@ ing such a destructive government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacked the police , election observers and town councils for ignor@@ ing evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up ab@@ outs outside of voting boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should show an identification document in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address .
the report proposes that non @-@ removable ink can be applied to a person &apos;s finger when they give up their vote to prevent anyone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ ne Rah@@ man should be removed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person as someone else chooses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system , including leading outs to prove the identity .
in his report it states : &quot; as evidence , it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns ... governmental institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such a behaviour from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ sensitivity in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists work on letter selection papers to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to the choice of your identification .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are random@@ ly eligible .
a three year limitation on applications to an automatic letter dial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban political activists to complete complete let@@ ter@@ elections and envel@@ opes from let@@ ter@@ elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs to set up poll@@ ing stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law that simpli@@ fies an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go to the voting booth on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ ne Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city council elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heir to the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are over@@ seen by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who turned out to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic med@@ alli@@ st is by far not the only athle@@ tic athlete who has his own famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see any simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American has been att@@ ested by fans to match an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the lik@@ eness of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons include Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own gorgeous , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off , when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 0s outdoor swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as M@@ ief , died like a pig .

the Chinese swimming pool Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to open the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get it that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m s@@ wimming@@ pool staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard , many of whom were talking about him .
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the broadcast C@@ BC , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who replied to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
the author Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers rather than on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made following the ladies swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not relate to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman sam@@ pled under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ garments , &quot; she moved and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , got dressed and turned out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother anyone watching or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home trousers which were touching another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out the clothes from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman took her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapon attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers nearby .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer over for your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn yourself first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the gun &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat your knees in the gro@@ in and twist , while the attack@@ er cl@@ aps in from pain , the weapon is out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
at attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , put the weight on the weapon and hit the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip , before they move backwards and put the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ took his immune system and th@@ rot@@ tle for a serious trial - by le@@ aning out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ab@@ te his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a fl@@ ushing button of a draw facility and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before firing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to ch@@ ew the fl@@ ushing button of a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria are found .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily , nothing left what he li@@ cked up , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to dish@@ washing bones of toilets , the task was definitely put to the test by his immune system
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his probe showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of newly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick , after her lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while newly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Da@@ iry Products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call on Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you this - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a social family left their social housing after del@@ o@@ zing with a loss of £ 50,000 because it terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ che@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were rolling holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as nice part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dations of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , gave an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were rou@@ gh@@ ened
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and called to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ved her and her partner by force this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ on were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not afraid of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always terrible .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have ab@@ hor@@ red the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing considers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ zing on the floor .
workers in the administration will now have to leave the garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in merchant vision .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall announced that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the air strikes stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when sc@@ ary tourists started to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashed across a crowded beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the bushes , without first seeing what came on them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted video about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility of nearby area fires , but the air forces insisted that security at no time was at risk .
surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , including four people on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and smoke , which limited his view .
the airplane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise

the world ranking first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final match as expected and made the title with each other .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non Chinese on the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they didn &apos;t have coaches .
they had retired to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches for my country here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had drawn a rib@@ bing injury which afterwards had to be satisfied with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states losing their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now identified weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment in which the multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually appeared as somewhat mira@@ cul@@ ously and self @-@ confident as reported by correspon@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own republi@@ can camp , doubts grow in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
if he had false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media file .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds wi@@ ggle
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ors in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were syn@@ onymous with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
also , Arizona and Georgia are considered endangered .
in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
and afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey results .
instead , it is hoped that the candidates of the Republi@@ cans will be more under arms for Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic Games : tri@@ ck@@ gering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ oping @-@ Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer at home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to set up a disciplinary committee immediately in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , put a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the team leader in Kenya by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the International Association of IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesman indicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control unit and retired as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , signed and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan CEO de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training inspections of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was in Beijing &apos;s World Cup arena in 2015 more than 800 meters .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports he was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was usually noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commen@@ ced .
as a result , WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is con@@ forming to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he employed her in the Russian athle@@ tics field .
in this case , it was possible to prove that in this type of sport was widespread and systematically thought .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ uten@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchest@@ ral pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with nostal@@ gia of her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli says the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for him , conducting is a necessity .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as it was then .
59 years later the play is still relevant .

Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , was reported to have died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV news on Thursday reported .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had for@@ s@@ aken the land @-@ torn country and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London went on a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says that in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton is going to be a candidate for the Supreme Court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will nom@@ inate the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the supreme court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans were blocking Gar@@ land &apos;s nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ ats wants to Calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish an 1970 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from classic school play@@ boys as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classic naked , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally by an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog und Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany comp@@ utes on short notice with tens of thousands of protection seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term there could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believes the president of the federation , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with criminal charges months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the tar@@ nished put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would still be added .
many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that accepts refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the Union lam@@ ented the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the expression of travel to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Union demanded that the Federal Government positions itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand of fire as a Gü@@ len pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and the secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Learning Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set up the biggest group of asylum @-@ holders , recognised for political persecution in Germany , in front of the coup .
on the date of the June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those who fled from war , poverty or lack of perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia can not vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 is not going to take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that &apos;s bit@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
practical problems come up : during the holidays hel@@ pers , infl@@ ate posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate voices in the end , just ti@@ res@@ ome .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave for once again election campaigns against the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just like his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and there is Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Home Secretary Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major explor@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group voted not : there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , meaning Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you crum@@ ble the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire again to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the sides of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD was clearly won by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the land tag .
they make a modern virtue out of vacation @-@ need and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the regional president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for domestic stimul@@ ants among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , curves straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg &apos;s lakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ ur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 : 00 p.m. , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south as planned at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
it is also praised that the opposite of those responsible for the construction works , for example when it comes to the establishment of kes@@ hi@@ ft entran@@ ces .
since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now sail on both sides from O@@ fter@@ dal to the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ asive way through the town seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant problems , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eks were looking for and more familiar with their na@@ vi than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks rent in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the congregation was demanding the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who informed himself on the spot on the spot .
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the road with 77 km kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers coming from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 san@@ itation has led to sales break@@ through@@ s , everyone you ask has to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the most light decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maturity is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily mined are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refur@@ bish@@ ment has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancelled its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the note answered , the restaurant otherwise benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a more generous one has been handled .
in all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also somewhere else nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his stem cells will come back after the renovation works .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction , that &apos;s brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly scre@@ wed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim no one .
other , further points would be discussed first within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he had obtained results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
a few things have already been known , announced , filed : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and push jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they sometimes have it : he plans fast methods for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of ac@@ qui@@ escence for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
some still have an un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and in some points - in im@@ patient treatment - for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says De Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures .
and things that people deeply employed could not be clas@@ ped in election @-@ time periods .
the inner security is hu@@ gely moved into focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly gaining position in the subject of inner security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ome dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the heads of the resort also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
there is nothing to stop from getting away from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it makes sense to re@@ open them .
and in case of a bur@@ q@@ out ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally stable at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , has yet to show itself .
there &apos;s a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD , too , is currently trying to improve on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel cau@@ tioned cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still , Volkswagen will get off lightly .
despite diesel costs , delivery numbers worldwide are increasing .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen will start delivery in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel variant , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show an increase in spite of the diesel @-@ powered market thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand declined mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars around the world to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , sales fell 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries collap@@ sed by almost one sixth .
sales of brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there was a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for ex@@ iting from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the gas affair first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the predominantly affected local brand of the Lower Saxony is continuing to lightly due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months there is only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating with a software exhaust request .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after re@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer declares a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why legal intri@@ c@@ acies are the reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully comp@@ lied with the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after retro@@ fitting , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not , as it was said in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage does not have anything to do with it .
in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck scandal has resulted in uncertainty regarding possible guarantees of warranty as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands considerable savings from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : normal savers have to &quot; not fear &quot; to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot;
if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he has been keeping 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t pay for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now continues to pay for the cost according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle .
to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of cooperative associations in Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically resili@@ ence is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with p@@ uni@@ tive interest rates for deposits of 3 million Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide wages for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele , which is more luxuri@@ ant by the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is fierce , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to compete .
customers in Germany will not like this in terms of width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged dear plates .
before you ha@@ sten to comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ a men of the Middle Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the oft @-@ mentioned resurrection of records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ een after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something stupid like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , that I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have led people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an infrin@@ gement of the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans of record feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that evo@@ ke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have record players they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoo@@ thed by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just recently came in and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Vinyl , so I can put them on the shelves , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ less , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go into .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sexually packed pop , instead of experimental jazz , we@@ aves from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks odd , but gna@@ wing psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates to be sold .
it is more of a window @-@ shopping than shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so gathering records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am trying to se@@ duce the pants pants , I observe a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , do not take into account the large number of female collector who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by stro@@ lling through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by records , while avoiding the star@@ tling view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which sal@@ v@@ age a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also argued that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 temporary establishments , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than only nour@@ ishing people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is operated wis@@ ely and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his disap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , cycling pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get caught up .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight ahead , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his miserable , twel@@ fth place on the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time travel of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in silence what grounds had led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who on Wednesday had lost five minutes more than three minutes at Olympic champi@@ ons Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different German states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are supposed to transfer speed com@@ posting particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ated bridges with temporary speed cameras , there is often no infrastructure needed to provide a stationary lightning for adher@@ ence to speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with Laser @-@ Meas@@ u@@ rement , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans after time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer , according to the manufacturer , can be moved in a state @-@ driven state with every car with tow hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sho@@ ck@@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various German states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji gets master@@ class gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance with 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back , line running and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was lost through the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the stark defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but no matter how Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal round his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan she lost any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks of G@@ Bs for fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au rav@@ aged in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a cl@@ ums@@ y T@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it stopped Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute athlete , For@@ em@@ al@@ ua showed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ whi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pit@@ ted through other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and r@@ ushed to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still being learned .
this is how it is .
GB carried out basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ ph@@ ans , whose fans sang , wa@@ ving flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged himself and the UK ki@@ cked out cr@@ ushing into the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als at 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal below the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ als than with these games and that will mean what .
from the first ru@@ dder angle to the last , 220 hard h@@ ers that go down in history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was there when she row@@ ed to the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports that made such a measure .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th un@@ cann@@ y commitment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not fully reflect the triumph of triumph .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on on willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more assistant than the trainer who didn &apos;t know about 30 months ago whether he would ever survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
there is little change in the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if this is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and walked around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked as well .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard time with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called , &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for 31 years for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary in Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water tank association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of a while ago in the original on in a contribution by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia defended the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Mitarbeiter , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member churches are the municipalities of Kirch@@ hoff , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the association &apos;s association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the new purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there has been no down@@ time and there are always innovations added because water means life means that water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Go@@ epp@@ ner &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has worked with much lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association down@@ right as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the recipe for success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised water go@@ al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the association &apos;s association as highlights from his point of view .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe burst at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ hoff on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the pot@@ able water tank association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
however , the eight year old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and mort@@ ally injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him I am publicly prosec@@ uted .
in the meantime , because Sven S. might be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters big , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is a few years old though .
in the meantime , the man bears a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , like the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to make any statements about the departure or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police speaker in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special case squ@@ ad ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - a light @-@ view for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ stri@@ pped and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green power subsidies are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with the commission@@ er for competition Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , there is an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission rights trade climate and employment targets are weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall , CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
in the past year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer country , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , cast iron into the world market .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies with price d@@ umping .
over the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have an impact ; on the other , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
most recently , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
the Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an increase in orders thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing good sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp was accompanied by singing her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the Magi@@ st@@ erium study , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing is moving - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
regular gather@@ ings enable sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve at age , then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ar@@ du@@ ous in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs on a regular basis will not be able to get out of the pu@@ ff quickly even in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes a lot of memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers ab@@ sin@@ ge in long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you get through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do long for something , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
so there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir , you can simply join them .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
if you feel like singing , you should definitely join a chor@@ us , advises H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ aming of the kit@@ tens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of kit@@ tens have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ st@@ asy also left the males not cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of kit@@ tens on the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent more quickly to sounds of kit@@ tens , who are in great need to find out how scientists have found out about the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
cats respond also to the calls of kit@@ tens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding , said of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten cries were different with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight females from the hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a pack of small children , taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ tens that were raised in addition .
despite the low sample , the researchers keep their results in a meaningful way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls were played out by the very excited kit@@ tens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males at all re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Bar@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski ki@@ cks off with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : business as usual .
even when the state of emergency came to a stand@@ still in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens would not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
football does not stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
according to this , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has no effect on the life of most Turks but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night @-@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be over on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proves its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 victory @-@ hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion had a conci@@ li@@ atory end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round @-@ out K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also got off in the Europe League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g , there was only to sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cont@@ enk@@ ö@@ y laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract with AC Florence , was announced after the coup attempt , not to return to his European holiday because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce around one third of his estimated annual sal@@ aries estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot compete in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the subject of dop@@ ing continues to dominate the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swimming pool Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ ova , who after a D@@ oping @-@ Sper@@ re had compla@@ ined about her star status shortly before the games , was raff@@ led off and bu@@ gged at her start ( 100 m chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
there was a bizarre scenario : she was still in the hall with a big smile and prov@@ oked with her performance .
when determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a ju@@ bil@@ ation .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start of the Rio Olympics despite the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion from 2004 and former world champion has been running faster than ever since he has been the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to shut off a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after you have been given the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympics Champion was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive intake and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion above 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been bl@@ amed mar@@ ching .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als afterwards recognized .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Championship title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 due to testosterone deficiency .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained due to a judgement of the International Sports Court in CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold favor@@ i@@ tin wasn &apos;t tested until May , but may nevertheless start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement was found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and was already running on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ß , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had suffered prun@@ ing wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but had already left it again .
she planned her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sch@@ nö@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
two explo@@ sives had once again set up Friday morning , while another person was killed by the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular holiday resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate went into the air in a flower bed@@ et in front of the coast police station .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks wear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express yourself on possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks which is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police advised their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security surrounding major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips into these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) is valid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Minister President Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , re@@ members itself to have restored the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslims in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok during the attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been suggested by the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Democrats Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eating of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are portrayed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
this is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional protection in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices during the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court chief .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with juven@@ ile language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
that is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to the Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t know how to do that .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether or not the party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this cannot be seen .
with regard to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism .
but in recent years we have found that there can be some rights @-@ horror structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other ri@@ gh@@ tist terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers , refugee disasters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be discern@@ ed .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
at the same time , Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodation have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or fans of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , but who have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympi@@ ans or world records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ la was then transferred to the viral interaction .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year old finished his CV with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which drew attention from the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special status law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming better known in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have also been drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimming@@ pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a previous course over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old didn &apos;t learn to swim just eight months before Olympic and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so closely
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , it was al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist group Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the Post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
in the near future , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
from next year onwards , the Post also plans to offer its electric v@@ ans on the open car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to sell to a third party in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Post @-@ Spe@@ aker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to other companies .
post @-@ Board Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ des had said that there are repeatedly inquiries , such as by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to enlarge its fleet of electric cars and spare parts in the long run a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management begins following disap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K Consumer Research Group exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K confirmed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more in@@ secure the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after again disap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the global number five of the industry is facing a new start .
G@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert will already be leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger already announced the management of the executive board as early as September 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokesman on Friday did not want to mention details .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in the circles of investors , it was said on Friday that in the event of the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring that had been initiated years ago was great .
since 2011 Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ RP business figures , every shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also make the quot@@ as so , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have the chance to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales shr@@ ank to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million by 3.4 per cent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter imp@@ acted above all on the decline in value of the company .
the company sales amor@@ tization of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , had a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
the Gf@@ K still generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - bus stops in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ rel in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
during the accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , reported the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus company of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to do@@ dge its alle@@ gi@@ ance to an opposite truck which partly ro@@ de on the tram .
the bus arrived right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman reported to the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ese district of P@@ ew@@ ald .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
from 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of sewage will be 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 instead of 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvements are necessary .
according to an over@@ estimated calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf then will be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover works for these se@@ wer systems .
due to legal bases , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt displayed the body , a new calculation of fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be equ@@ aled .
Schmidt explained the fact that all three wastewater plants are relatively small , with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
because of the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the period covered in the calculation , all three plants had a considerable size not least due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that in the wastewater facility , Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage .
after almost 20 years of operation , the first clari@@ fication pond had to be extended and the slu@@ dge removed and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to meet the legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous fiscal year 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the absence of sewage in the three plants , the expenditure for the operation and maintenance was &quot; fully carried out . &quot;
in the process , Schmidt explained that the market community has been spar@@ ed from large maintenance costs in the waste water systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run according to stone houses , especially since one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al waste water tank in order to not expand these facilities because these facilities are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , were recorded as positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of July ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell for clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre@@ mon@@ ate with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect has been critic@@ ised as an Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting by Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are bl@@ unt , property @-@ turning tools that generate more than 30 million improvement sel@@ fies a day .
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat Fil@@ ters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a filter proposed this week to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yellow haw@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced eu@@ gen@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the an@@ ion comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and mil@@ dly unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ resistant , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degra@@ ding extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ er in the race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ho@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult to keep things un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and urged others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the partially white , only male leadership , and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently hired a personnel officer who focuses on dis@@ oriented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will close her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Command for@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence service information , re@@ jects the Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence gathering information to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the real conditions were allowed on the ground , a committee of inquiry of the congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Committee Commit@@ tees , Secret Service Commit@@ tees and Non @-@ budget@@ ary Com@@ mit , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command key intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically clever@@ ly exploited by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a more positive image of the US efforts against terrorism than the real states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the report stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ ul could begin in April or May 2015 .
the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ year 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans were calling the Task Force to life after it was admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations into the Cent@@ com reports are ongoing by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ ranking committee in committee tea , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , according to Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the moral in analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr Schiff and the Democrats announced no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team confirms that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation as these temporary refin@@ eries had put in operation to sell oil on the black market .
this realization , however , has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the Legis@@ lative Assembly for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US won fourth match for women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after they scored three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field squ@@ ad team of women in a Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember what has ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that : the Americans are at the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
however , as always the game may start on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind of their success story four years after they landed on the last of 12 places at the last London games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , where everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a return strike from the local area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough match and lasted from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a r@@ att@@ ling relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the cross@@ bow arch@@ ers to the athlete for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation during the queue in the coff@@ es@@ hop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , would definitely have been among these known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event equal .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may it be long .
but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely noticed that many people I had asked did not know that it is an Olympic event at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ines jump has a certain out@@ sider &apos;s character , partly because it is more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ onist tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending bul@@ ging - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and let@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad programme , they will be rated according to the performance , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
medal hopes must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the goal , sometimes to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they chase not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also another high goal in the broadcast transmission : the world or the Olympia Tower .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel more ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she colli@@ des , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters , demanding political changes in Ethiopia , hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at sho@@ ot@@ ings .
is Ethiopia closer together ?
in the last ten years it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that police fired and killed eigh@@ ty un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably the last or earlier of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Africa Project Manager of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror haz@@ ards across the region , especially Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba &apos;s capital .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it &apos;s breaking out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ew@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit and re @-@ arm the turbul@@ ence in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of dr@@ ink@@ ing@@ ness under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services have improved .
even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians predicted that they were gathered in such a way that they were prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atus Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in an un@@ published disease in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections which , according to analysts , apparently were pla@@ gu@@ ed by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest relatively quickly passed .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ used city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hate towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although she recently announced that she closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS to be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public .
it also brings out its fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant .
after announ@@ cing the announcement at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump recalls the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that he would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted to know nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has attempted to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey results .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump had once again tried to return to this subject .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even better tone as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of fame , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it am@@ bush @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and accused them of carrying on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television expert who tried to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s exc@@ uses as proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
crowded at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was not Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displaced .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people kidn@@ apped it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised club café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time member of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ es like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natur@@ alistic dishes .
the café serves no beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed aside from Willi@@ am@@ sburg by awards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb had closed , she had the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably employed the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual ordering , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he won &apos;t take a gru@@ dge on the fact that the soap business has occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he &apos;s ready to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb suff@@ ices to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for ingenious delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pu@@ dding pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There was also a message to Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ it &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while bri@@ ck@@ man is told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small snack bar in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive @-@ pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ edge roast , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there were car@@ rots , liver cream cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must have been like lead in the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet .
teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways the country was about to stop being the land of milk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; Co@@ e said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new budget was just as exciting : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
unique bl@@ ends were tried out as a high @-@ calorie and nutrient @-@ like satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economics recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - under@@ took the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget polic@@ y@@ makers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to meet the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
especially pal@@ atable are the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Food pose .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million@@ aire man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was completely foreign to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper &apos;s lawyers did not show any interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the types from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back on its legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the van@@ guard incident .
after clearing the plates near Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a bad trick to humble a decent name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each th@@ aw something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .

CO@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he used his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers play their own lives in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and help them first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Prot@@ ector , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour cleansing of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four drum bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image rec@@ ites its last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ ries usually only come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea following an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k only get offspring for 150 years .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it &apos;s average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter long animal acceler@@ ates on sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle embos@@ sed by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ist gu@@ essed that Greenland shar@@ k becomes a stone age long ago .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers have little to say about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries .
their slow tempo , they measured , when they fitted six animals with a transmitter , in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
loo@@ t also make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland H@@ ouses , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest proportion was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remarkably high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons retri@@ eved larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the 220 @-@ centimet@@ re length of the third smallest animal , the l@@ enti@@ l @-@ core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon tests , it should therefore have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ ths , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 levels in their lens nucle@@ us , created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to map the length of an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously takes at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bacon tied at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently also runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so you later mature - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal bites heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
at the latest meeting , the Municipal Council has focused on issues relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel announced the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , plot and development issues were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ burger Straße &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ tension section 1 ) has nothing to do with interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau am addressing young families and troubled sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , members of the town council are now able to report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to deliber@@ ate in its September meeting .
in order to meet requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ timer area , the already proven business park is wi@@ dened by two parallel plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets are allowed to continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is sufficient .
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they are reloc@@ ating jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervis@@ or E@@ IO@@ PA and the venture ES@@ R@@ B .
while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is a big fund industry , it also cuts out the infrastructure of Dublin as much as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the large airport .
the city also features readily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not as easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says .
at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of Mer@@ cer &apos;s consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg ranked 7th , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the econom@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead takes legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc has been entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which arose in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the My@@ th and other un@@ ethical actions .
at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of Commerce , Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck filed against each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , which provided sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
the United States supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokesman on Friday .
the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared by Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under perfect control now , but we are just carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton Hill earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its 2015 tax return on Friday , resulting in a USD 10.@@ 75 million income for the Democrats and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax statements for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false expressions and withdraw@@ als concerning his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not required by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wrote campaign hero@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the release of the Democrats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump &apos;s Special Ad@@ visor told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspections are not complete .
tr@@ umps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charity organisations , his business conduct and various other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already stum@@ bled on the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ level Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump invites him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the past decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate held its seat here , took Tr@@ ump to a meeting to share their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax test of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns policy back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were paid as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanzania &apos;s elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ des .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion along with the US natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the day , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without hur@@ ting the elephant , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is tos@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mixed with earth , mix together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition string .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spray fine dust in the air .
a touch quite usually is already sufficient to chase the elephant .
a last opportunity presents a gol@@ fer who shoots a fire @-@ fired fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ator into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council deliber@@ ates unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk construction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

the application for the new construction of a sal@@ es@@ woman at the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s , which was currently under construction , however rejected the city council unanim@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new businesses , but in this location in an exposed position on the Rhine shore , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ash Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media rebellion after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election since it had &quot; requested &quot; Arab guests according to an employee .
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
she wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large internet resonance in which people called it a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give in to the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ for@@ estation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students clas@@ hed with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the introduction of rubber shells and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after prot@@ esters walked into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
the lifting of sanctions increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , between Moscow and Teher@@ an .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies increased strongly to businesses in the country , the ambassador shared .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the greatest priority of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the sales revenue between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan estimates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily to travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market over@@ falling in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y occurred on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the gu@@ ide@@ book of a gun weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had paraly@@ zed their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been exploited .
the perpetrators were to have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small .
the drink market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the re@@ we market and is easily accessible .
the perpetrators will have to travel to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have to flee from the dirt car park located opposite the car park entrance , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently report to the police .

eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ loving group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school holidays in the quiet village of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ ills with the visit to the mat@@ el@@ z@@ oos .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days , the group at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ ers were spoiled with their own prepared dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .

&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ eb@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen .
four stages were tac@@ kled together .
in order to bridge the time up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all the young stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ mini@@ stries round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ term pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally it was decided for the Bishop of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the open gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral was offered a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the children of the holy things , went their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ks sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and blessed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by rail to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgri@@ m route from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way the min@@ is at field cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches always made R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for the nights .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed the Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road but had to dig around 500 metres of altitude at Rin@@ ser &apos;s heat and then climbed again .
in the evening , the earned reward was a common gri@@ lling on the bathing pond .
after dawn on the 4th pilgri@@ m &apos;s day in the imposing church of St. Peter , we headed towards Freiburg .
the Min@@ is met visi@@ bly and happily arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a small impulse .
at the evening mass in Münster , the min@@ is arrived at the destination was welcomed by the operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow assumed the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he was proud of the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the London rail world championships in London in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement has created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic @-@ ord in the qualifying rounds but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der lay down slightly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that led behind in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make myself a name .
in the final round we set up an Olympic champion and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he was argu@@ ing yesterday with representatives before the qualification when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong team of trains to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to med@@ als with med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ist and bul@@ lying designs as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ g@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake because the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all delivery contracts , as the supplying energy company shared .
this move was followed by the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to plant the plant .
a maxim@@ inum pa@@ yout for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ places in the site of Al@@ coa , Port@@ land , stand at stake .
no less than 2,000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt energy consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loos@@ es money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ ash with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt @-@ making industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also stated that the treaties are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging operations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point of view , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that the value of the Tre@@ aties had already been depreci@@ ated in his year @-@ end in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a declaration , why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic situation in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ ing mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analy@@ tic statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ane reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted US vo@@ gue edition .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , frozen reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) that ends with a classic twist : they all planned a surprise party .
that puts the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action on nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have struck her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut fashi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is eag@@ erly awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the journal le@@ aked out before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , more celeb@@ ri@@ ties have been &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes not everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ler &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called them &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps .
she is selling images of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres each year draw up to 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry insi@@ sts on the effects of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ on or similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources .
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell community centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed because of separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to see the needs of the community centres and their customers , as well as the fact that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after collabor@@ ators allegedly drew fire@@ arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on a staff in February , while in February they were traveling in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave on to have been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate broke up a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and arms friends - should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and ap@@ point judge .
s@@ ling@@ backs campaign clearly stated that the media tore his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting mental harm . &quot; &quot; &quot;

try to contact Philip as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are being held .
these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the black @-@ black government coalition in the north could barely keep governing , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to set the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come again to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were back in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at the parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the pol@@ l , the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus remain behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left by 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not miss the introduction in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator was on the market .
the sequ@@ el@@ ers dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Büro in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ Format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , if also agon@@ izing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
to be online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has grown around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , while Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily serve everything via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today , every German today looks like 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we played a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we have already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces to create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the He@@ ath@@ row Expansion is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in social growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s two high @-@ frequency cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; concerning ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors try to avoid ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect whether advertising is part of the advertising page .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of back @-@ and @-@ forth battle between the decent open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing have been underway since the invention of scor@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon coming up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying advertising sl@@ ats have become the industry .
according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ wers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company refra@@ ined from distributing ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokesperson said .
advertising on Desktop PCs takes a lot of money so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ dresses were new filters of concern because they would block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have focused instead on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
transfer woman to Swiss free@@ way with presum@@ ed suicide
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss did not want to kill himself at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck .
she died on the ground .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident sum@@ mon@@ ed to report .
an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter stated to the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases , in which a person ran on the highway in the dark , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was said in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted after having crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 highway near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious in the street , took the judgment .
the court stated that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ro@@ de to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA &apos;s climate model : Venus once inhabited
the Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could once have rejected Earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still turned on slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this he@@ ats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was presumably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gene escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with@@ drew with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I was thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations need to be perfectly att@@ un@@ ed to that of the organization .
he also has to have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and we wish him only the best for the future .
in the 2013 @-@ 14 A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league .
he led the club on 112 points and first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed out in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches in the 2015 @-@ 16 season recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal g@@ Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike out strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles with respect to pay for the North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit down at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
action against the Wood Group oil @-@ field service provider was conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present dispute , &quot; it says in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start early next year to tackle problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced its rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a consequence of its mega @-@ contract with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of approximately $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star @-@ pile to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods stand with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest now .
at peak @-@ rot@@ ation@@ rates , these mature stars meet large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds are blowing through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ving more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to learn about what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ year @-@ old All @-@ Star Game player of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) announced .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to become the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
he signed his signature under a ten @-@ year contract since 2007 to 27 million US dollars a year .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full pay .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he has managed to make some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted into the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star appeared at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered prime suspect to have been receiving performance @-@ promoting agents for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in southern Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said in a swe@@ e@@ the@@ art then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ expressions of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch @-@ rival Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : on account of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
the chin@@ ese swimming pool Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weight @-@ wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the un@@ time .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Justice CA@@ S confirmed the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) asked for an opening of the B rehear@@ sal and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association takes the matter very seriously and calls for full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua in a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Women &apos;s Court and will accept the verdict . &quot;
the first time in history is not the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eping over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act in the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately expressed criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation must not take part in Rio .
on Friday also the case of Adrian Ziel@@ inski , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both deny the intake ; however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation of IA@@ AF forbi@@ ds the entire Russian squ@@ ad to the start , except for systematic dop@@ ing , and the Kenya L@@ äu@@ fer nation produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also had taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing dec@@ ei@@ vers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had a positive impact on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ia in Chinese championships , but had to shut down only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware scan targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by malware Defence specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , some times a number of victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for ex@@ tor@@ ting ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently observing a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malaria programs were designed to send advertising .
then the cul@@ pr@@ its discovered black@@ mail software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as filing images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the black@@ mail recei@@ v@@ ables .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , it is important for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
accordingly , the damage exp@@ els when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat@@ ting how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , establish freely accessible support websites or unlock for free example files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payment of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus vendor Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is more likely that they are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail servers .
the malware campaigns developed so that the malware itself , consulting , and additional tools have been purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on data backup and scanner software to ward off ran@@ som@@ ware .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful verification , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the con Conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control connected with the Internet .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators are blocking an entire production line in a factory , instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could become a topic even in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers in the first row and rear have a lot of space , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l when folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie chair and provide storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , however , the 650 mm charge height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
he should , however , turn his work somewhat more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant ( works until Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed sensor responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles on demand the speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger air@@ lift bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable for haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
after their trip , ill tourists only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without any doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease attributed the tourists to a defective treatment plant which supposedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family thought that the trip would have been fla@@ wed - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment .
no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 dise@@ ased .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terror haz@@ ards .
one thing is certain : our country will not be able to answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if the perpetrators are to flee the country more quickly , however , this increases the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of the proposals to the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ vi@@ per size order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting terrorism should again stand under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved to am@@ end weapons law , making it more difficult to buy weapons on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a look at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against activ@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear file for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under constitutional law , he considers a general prohibition of full wear .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I refuse to wear the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of building with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ acts of action and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway feeder
it st@@ umps periodi@@ cally on the circum@@ stance - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal separation shall be prolonged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding street every night in traffic jam if they drive over the highway to feeder ( A 43 ) .
the road construction project length@@ ens on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit of Wes@@ er Straße the right @-@ click track at 700 meters .
car drivers can then turn right from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early on , whereby the total can be improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the districts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VP @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drivers on the feeder are especially nervous between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage extends to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the descent of the Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is guided only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt several years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge would no longer have the required load capacity , in order to take the heavy @-@ load traffic two lanes .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related work @-@ day traffic jam will last will not be able to say the responsible state company .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal licence , the state company deliberately chose the traffic weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima Association and the Junge theatre are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee camp to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theater in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project .
most of the youngsters of the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the young theater in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Vo@@ cle , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increasing number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather cleared the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in southwest Germany on Friday to Friday a line - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest falling stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping problems
in the evening , one rolls around forever , at night one is lying awake for hours , in the morning already far ahead of the alarm ring is no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is dealing with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many reasons behind them , &quot; stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand , for the time being , is in@@ som@@ nia , which means sleeping and sleeping .
just falling asleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board at the German GP association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s Beh@@ ind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
this can include organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
sleep disorder frequently is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors interact with each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it may be bad , wake up every two or three hours , and possibly start to gre@@ p about everyday problems and worries , gives you an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I consult your doctor with sleeping disorders ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised in the day should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is worn off , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out what causes them .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité University Medical Center , emphas@@ ises low @-@ seated sleep professionals in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems , advises Weber .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what &apos;s going on ?
for example , for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise against snor@@ ing with breathing equipment , in case of abnormal wear@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explained fixing .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , you go to bed for a normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera is attached to the bed@@ side at the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few jack@@ bolts on which you can sit for a better sleep .
it matters : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is not beneficial at all .
what the jungle camp has to have missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ f has commented on Facebook for the disap@@ pointing out@@ crop of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ f has placed himself in front of his criticism standing ex @-@ team@@ mates in front of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € , no one should be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that do so much and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not able to control WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested in Düsseldorf &apos;s police .
the susp@@ ects had made several hand@@ bags and baggage ste@@ els as gang members .
at 9.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf area recognized a band known to the police from past rob@@ ber@@ ies .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July of this year and were in a community , work @-@ oriented and especially professional .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ al 34 can demonstrate four deeds to the thi@@ eves who have been specially trained to commit crimes to Germany .
in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lime trees , in between a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl that is to be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the appropriate real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Interior Minister , Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , were cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled over three weeks official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers followed the ju@@ bil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others chat@@ ting about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are mostly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who mostly longed for police protection from the left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the dit@@ ch that the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between house owners and their neighbours does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including nearly the entire Mainz @-@ based street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election ber@@ liners from all over the world in recent years : residents of the GDR and former home@@ owners now share their neighborhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on thrown windows or newly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ autonomous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes involve damage to property , which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated buildings .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the ri@@ gging road - and has remained .
this is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : police , politics and the media who suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through sigh@@ ted new@@ buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for a lot of people here - people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never listen to it ?
fru@@ stration comes on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out people who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can &apos;t complain about noise there .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee en@@ voy
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ ett@@ ling Woll@@ mel@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking - meant targeting the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
he was looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an uns@@ ett@@ ling Woll@@ mel@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central issue , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon to be found in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the municipalities themselves have to pay the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
responsibility altern@@ ates from the District Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t work so far , whether you depend on private apartments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why common apartments need to be emp@@ tied , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed place there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not mean work only .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , administration and honorary officials also jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example by language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anybody in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there is also problem cases , says the customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also an issue for refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will bring them out completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
the main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
in this context , they always have in mind that a new stock of refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself .
actually it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy to integrate the existing persons sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lars were looking for helicop@@ ters
