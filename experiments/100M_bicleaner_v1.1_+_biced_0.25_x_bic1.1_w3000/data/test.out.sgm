<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with some colleagues at the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramids" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses recalled on their eve, they galloped back home to feed in the fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother to take pictures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sporting aid presented the man from Anhausen in the scope of a small gala the Golden World Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable athlete does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump Policies in Comparison: it's All about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trading agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental principle." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive back regulators massively, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, states:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to open and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich are increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost wordy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and build coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in protected areas, it wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment programme Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly build up renewable energy and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazitive trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but rather protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should be paid even better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger pay.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rattled, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Director of Condrobs, a supporter of social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are chickens.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs took up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for the flight: "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, confuses, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior or abused at worst.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not voluntary." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence, some answer no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodation of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia, even fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly slippily and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly expressed his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable cooling effluent by Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was floodlighted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin got the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shook him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedasti expressed it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued grudge about the slug's rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pivotal to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of state won a claim in Ankara for sure that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow which has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray a "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now fade.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they did not even understand the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey has deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey kicked off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest alliance of confidence for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, Putin is saying that without giving reasons for" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs, Putin has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy to Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that later he was the chief executive officer and commander of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state with respect to legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidanes Vladimir Putin and worked as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once toured as a potential president would like to direct Russian environmental policy - came across big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - to entrust myself to a valuable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of his time violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closure of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 bevel cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Rosyth a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Seminar Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the shutter represents trend-setting up- and underground construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north turmdeck located in the expansion, we had to close the gap between the north and the south.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team work towards were tiny - on each side they saw only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig's favorable housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: in the future, investors should be taken into consideration much more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments over the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "room for action" at the next meeting of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable housing can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann said," "" "There is no agreement between the factions at present." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In spite of this, as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation in the housing market has crept in.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can we compensate for the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose support will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be sold-out binding from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about retrieving the apartments back into the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year there are periods in the Western city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be retrieved there back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing corporations.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is because the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically, away from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There shouldn't be more concentration of socially vulnerable in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be a movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "said S & D Group President Holger Herlitschke:" "" "the CDU must go into the boat for a large majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenage boys and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer spending their free time watching screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV set, then on video games, and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It goes without saying that I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell into effect at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand overloaded by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the USA, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person puts back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "to come from the sofa," "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships in the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also morific gamblers who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people hunt more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">All in all brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast joined the competition on Thursday and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles are touring the Swedish bar during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilal is the fourth heterosexual Americanist who wins a championship title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">She represents this success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles won the last three years of her sport, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou ett spoke of her that she is "the best gymnast that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women's gymnastics tournaments at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired Team Coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the picture insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are tuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she won no more competition in the competition, a winning streak that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina made it easy by two turns, the image clouded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating bars and floor urns - in which it holds the world title - guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her end - a mere formality - and tears streaming on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake at Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team capitol, who is called" "" "grandma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil practising, she knocked out kisses to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12th June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said that shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "said Howard der KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were tied up and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine to be part of the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls from other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kościan, the Catholicin, rounds off, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and he was jubilant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual Americanist who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this kind of sport, but so do gymnastics classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner primarily consists in private gymnastic clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner maintains its entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to make a more affordable and easier accessible turn training to the communities of the countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of Girl Power by the holding of the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to the dismissal of a government report.</seg>

<seg id="7">Beat your knees in the groin and twist, while the attacker claps in from pain, the weapon is out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the Attacker doesn't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the aggressor on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip, before they move backwards and put the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler undertook his immune system and throttle for a serious trial - by leaning out some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk schabte his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a draw facility and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before firing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to chew the flushing button of a draw toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria are found.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he licked up, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to railway stations to dishwashing bones of toilets, the task was definitely put to the test by his immune system</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probe showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of newly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick, after her luminometry was over 4000 units, while newly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Dairy Products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended we said" "" "Let's call on Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you this - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A social family left their social housing after delozing with a loss of £50,000 because it terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trechecock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were rolling holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as nice part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, gave an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were roughened</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and called to call the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delved her and her partner by force this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have abhorred the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a delogization is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in the administration will now have to leave the garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia can not vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 is not going to take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "it's not stupid as to date: summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - that's biting." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems come up: during the holidays helpers, inflate posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate voices in the end, just tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave for once again election campaigns against the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and there is Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Home Secretary Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to major explorations; Merkel's federal election district is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group voted not: there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, meaning Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you crumble the base, that it must be very strict to find a wire again to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any available in the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU voter Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD was clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of vacation-need and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign," "" "says the regional president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election campaigners embark on a search for domestic stimulants among the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8: 00 p.m., there are everywhere praise.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is also praised that the opposite of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of keshift entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "citizens can now sail on both sides from Ofterdal to the B 27." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive way through the town seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant problems," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeks were looking for and more familiar with their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks rent in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the congregation was demanding the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant excesses," says King, who informed himself on the spot on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 km kilometres in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers coming from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 sanitation has led to sales breakthroughs, everyone you ask has to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "at the most light decline" "" "at the Autohaus Maier, but also admits that, of course," "" "the maturity is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily mined are the local restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment has" "" "cancelled its operation" "" "for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the note answered, the restaurant otherwise benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where such a more generous one has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his stem cells will come back after the renovation works.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU-man admits." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still thinks this is reasonable and doesn't demand anything that doesn't have any chances with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>

<seg id="22">In case of acquiescence for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some still have an unwieldy effect and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - in impatient treatment - for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says De Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures.</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this reason, the Union and the SPD are increasingly gaining position in the subject of inner security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged dear plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hasten to comment section to see him under the pseudonym of non-Allea men of the Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the oft-mentioned resurrection of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foreseen after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something stupid like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, that I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men middle-aged) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers received an infringement of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans of record feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "said WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have record players they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoothed by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men middle-aged) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came in and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Vinyl, so I can put them on the shelves, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-less, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I go into.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer- and sexually packed pop, instead of experimental jazz, weaves from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but gnawing psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shopping than shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so gathering records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am trying to seduce the pants pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collector who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by records, while avoiding the startling view of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator who rises above the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hair, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which salvage a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also argued that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 temporary establishments, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais are absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than only nourishing people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is operated wisely and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure" "" "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans after time, travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance with 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stitching, back, line running and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stark defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But no matter how Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal round his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan she lost any game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau ravaged in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A clumsy Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it stopped Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athlete, Foremalua showed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-whiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pitted through other weak tacklings of the UK team and rushed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still being learned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sulphans, whose fans sang, waving flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged himself and the UK kicked out crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals at 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal below the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinals than with these games and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder angle to the last, 220 hard hers that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was there when she rowed to the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that made such a measure.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th uncanny commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the triumph of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion on willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more assistant than the trainer who didn't know about 30 months ago whether he would ever survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is little change in the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and walked around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp was accompanied by singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the Magisterium study, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is moving - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular gatherings enable seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve at age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be arduous in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs on a regular basis will not be able to get out of the puff quickly even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors-Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes a lot of memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers absinge in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you get through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do long for something, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir, you can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you feel like singing, you should definitely join a chorus, advises Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life life.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two explosives had once again set up Friday morning, while another person was killed by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation close to the popular holiday resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive rate went into the air in a flower bedet in front of the coast police station.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast, demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express yourself on possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks which is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police advised their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security surrounding major government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not address tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary trips into these provinces are discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (level 2) is valid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Minister President Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody upheaval, remembers itself to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslims in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during the attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.</seg>

<seg id="1">From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of sewage will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl, 3.44 instead of 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the waste water charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvements are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an overestimated calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf then will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that undercover works for these sewer systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt displayed the body, a new calculation of fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period can also be equaled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the fact that all three wastewater plants are relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the period covered in the calculation, all three plants had a considerable size not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that in the wastewater facility, Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">After almost 20 years of operation, the first clarification pond had to be extended and the sludge removed and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to meet the legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous fiscal year 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the absence of sewage in the three plants, the expenditure for the operation and maintenance was "fully carried out."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the process, Schmidt explained that the market community has been spared from large maintenance costs in the waste water systems over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the long run according to stone houses, especially since one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water tank in order to not expand these facilities because these facilities are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, property-turning tools that generate more than 30 million improvement selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat Filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when a filter proposed this week to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "Yellow hawk" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced eugenism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anion comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed across the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and mildly unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-resistant, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degrading extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverser in the race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snaphoats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult to keep things unnoticed than it was before," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the partially white, only male leadership, and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Command forfeits ISIS intelligence service information, rejects the Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence gathering information to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the real conditions were allowed on the ground, a committee of inquiry of the congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Committee Committees, Secret Service Committees and Non-budgetary Commit, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command key intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically cleverly exploited by high-ranking Centcom commanders, posted a more positive image of the US efforts against terrorism than the real states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range up to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "", "the report stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">The second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-year 2014 to mid-2015, Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans were calling the Task Force to life after it was admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports are ongoing by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "the highest-ranking committee in committee tea, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, according to Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the moral in analysts and" "" "gave excessively little space for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr Schiff and the Democrats announced no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts on a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the general inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team confirms that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation as these temporary refineries had put in operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This realization, however, has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative Assembly for his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a rattling relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the crossbow archers to the athlete for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation during the queue in the coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, would definitely have been among these known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely noticed that many people I had asked did not know that it is an Olympic event at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolines jump has a certain outsider's character, partly because it is more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist tremor of his never-ending bulging - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and scuba diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pike and lettos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympiad programme, they will be rated according to the performance, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopes must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high goal in the broadcast transmission: the world or the Olympia Tower.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel more tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collides, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, demanding political changes in Ethiopia, hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shootings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia closer together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed eighty unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably the last or earlier of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Africa Project Manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror hazards across the region, especially Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Abeba's capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the vast expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it's breaking out," "" "said Seewm Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to exploit and re-arm the turbulence in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of drinkingness under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians predicted that they were gathered in such a way that they were protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are coordinating under a screen," "" "said Mulatus Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amperas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in an unpublished disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections which, according to analysts, apparently were plagued by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this period of unrest relatively quickly passed.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amused city, attacked by Tigray and the hate towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although she recently announced that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS to be "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings out its fellow campaigners who endeavor to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After announcing the announcement at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalls the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that he would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while he has attempted to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey results.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump had once again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "according to what the reaction is." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even better tone as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of fame, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for ingenious delicacies on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle Soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a pudding pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Brickman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "There was also a message to Americans how to eat them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coit's last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while brickman is told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "their latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small snack bar in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive-pieces, while coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hedge roast, this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," Brickman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were carrots, liver cream cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "there must have been like lead in the stomach," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male Fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "records the ways the country was about to stop being the land of milk." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense subject," Coe said, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as exciting: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casseroles as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Brickman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique blends were tried out as a high-calorie and nutrient-like satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>

<seg id="29">Brickmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home economics recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - undertook the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "" "budget policymakers" "" "and to meet the challenge of converting Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals." ""</seg>

<seg id="35">Especially palatable are the reports on the response of the government to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-Me-Cake-Food pose.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he openly praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen, he feeds like the millionaire man of the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was completely foreign to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example of his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, a housekeeper's lawyers did not show any interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the types from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the country came back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hairies usually only come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea following an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only get offspring for 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it's average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle embossed by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionist guessed that Greenland shark becomes a stone age long ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little to say about the lifestyle of Greenland hairies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow tempo, they measured, when they fitted six animals with a transmitter, in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot also make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers, which torpedo from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland Houses, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest proportion was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably high carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons retrieved larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220-centimetre length of the third smallest animal, the lentil-core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon tests, it should therefore have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-haiths, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 levels in their lens nucleus, created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to map the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously takes at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methusalemes live above all in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon tied at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently also runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you later mature - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal bites heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media rebellion after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israel's pre-election since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," made his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all the young strants in two years, the Oberministries round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long-term pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally it was decided for the Bishop of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the open gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral was offered a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the children of the holy things, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storks sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed pilgrimages and blessed pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by rail to the starting point of Villingen, where a Muenster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrim route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the minis at field crossroads, chapels or churches always made Rast to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>

<seg id="15">In the evening, the earned reward was a common grilling on the bathing pond.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow assumed the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he was proud of the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the London rail world championships in London in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement has created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner put an Olympic-ord in the qualifying rounds but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders conquered in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder lay down slightly after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that led behind in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and make myself a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic champion and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>

<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a spoils of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was arguing yesterday with representatives before the qualification when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong team of trains to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to medals with medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexist and bullying designs as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velogrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake because the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This move was followed by the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to plant the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workplaces in the site of Alcoa, Portland, stand at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2,000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt energy consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting pot of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smash with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, where Chinese companies CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt-making industry," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL also stated that the treaties are so-called" "" "hedging operations" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that the value of the Treaties had already been depreciated in his year-end in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "Skill Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "did not compromise." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still a declaration, why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic situation in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmeling mill in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analytic statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this Covers brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">That puts the stereotyped action on nearly every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have struck her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is eagerly awaited, that in the last two years pictures of the journal leaked out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, more celebrities have been "celebrities that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners likes not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jennler's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called them "Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark in an act of desperation "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus could once have rejected Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still turned on slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate lives and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogene escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide withdrew with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star-pile to different rates, and in what context the rotational periods stand with the planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: on account of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An inquisitive athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping attacks in Rio de Janeiro have become known.</seg>
<seg id="6">The chinese swimming pool Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle-runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weight-weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions these news come to the untime.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Justice CAS confirmed the exclusion of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen had to take part in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked for an opening of the B rehearsal and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter very seriously and calls for full cooperation in the investigations, "said Xinhua in a message:" we will cooperate with the International Women's Court and will accept the verdict. "</seg>
<seg id="13">The first time in history is not the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeping over the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act in the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should also be positive." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately expressed criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-laden nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday also the case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake; however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation of IAAF forbids the entire Russian squad to the start, except for systematic doping, and the Kenya Läufer nation produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming-sport, the earlier offences in China also had taken care of violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle, I want to pass," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware scan targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by malware Defence specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, some times a number of victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for extorting ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malaria programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the culprits discovered blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as filing images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the blackmail receivables.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, it is important for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage expels when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chatting how they can pay by Bitcoin, establish freely accessible support websites or unlock for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payment of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus vendor Sophos:" "" "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that they are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail servers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware campaigns developed so that the malware itself, consulting, and additional tools have been purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then commission spammers with dissemination," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on data backup and scanner software to ward off ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful verification, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the con Conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat under their control connected with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are blocking an entire production line in a factory, instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could become a topic even in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers in the first row and rear have a lot of space, it does not work in any place.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie chair and provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, however, the 650 mm charge height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should, however, turn his work somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>

<seg id="23">"" "the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7" "" "touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around forever, at night one is lying awake for hours, in the morning already far ahead of the alarm ring is no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is dealing with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many reasons behind them, "stresses Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, for the time being, is insomnia, which means sleeping and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just falling asleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the German GP association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's Behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can include organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder frequently is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in a depression," "" "says Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors interact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, it may be bad, wake up every two or three hours, and possibly start to grep about everyday problems and worries, gives you an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I consult your doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised in the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is worn off, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out what causes them.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Professor Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité University Medical Center, emphasises low-seated sleep professionals in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems, advises Weber.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what's going on?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise against snoring with breathing equipment, in case of abnormal weariness, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explained fixing.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding, you go to bed for a normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is attached to the bedside at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few jackbolts on which you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It matters: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is not beneficial at all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested in Düsseldorf's police.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had made several handbags and baggage steels as gang members.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9.30 p.m., civilian officials in the Dusseldorf area recognized a band known to the police from past robberies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year and were in a community, work-oriented and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the crime commissarial 34 can demonstrate four deeds to the thieves who have been specially trained to commit crimes to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of lime trees, in between a remainder of cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl that is to be torn down soon, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the appropriate real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Interior Minister, Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, were cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled over three weeks official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers followed the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chatting about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are mostly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it does not sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who mostly longed for police protection from the left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Apparently, the ditch that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house owners and their neighbours does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including nearly the entire Mainz-based street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents of the GDR and former homeowners now share their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on thrown windows or newly painted facades that were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words" "" "Left-autonomous Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated buildings.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the rigging road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: police, politics and the media who suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through sighted newbuildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for a lot of people here - people who are not so well drunk," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can't approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listen to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">Frustration comes on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out people who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub, can't complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee envoy</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the unsettling Wollmelchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking - meant targeting the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an unsettling Wollmelchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central issue, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves have to pay the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility alternates from the District Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "it doesn't work so far, whether you depend on private apartments," "" "says Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">That is why common apartments need to be emptied, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed place there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who need to be undone or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not mean work only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, administration and honorary officials also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example by language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anybody in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there is also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people with whom nothing goes." therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: after the recent occurrences, do the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer very clearly," "" "what some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also an issue for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will bring them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">The main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In this context, they always have in mind that a new stock of refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach are already busy to integrate the existing persons sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
