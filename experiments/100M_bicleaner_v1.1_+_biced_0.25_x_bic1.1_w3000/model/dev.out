Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting is also aimed at the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and suggests Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama has deterior@@ ated further .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the ever @-@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor is admitted to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note dressed in a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb had done the fat@@ eful distress at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the State , as well as what students and staff knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself men@@ tions Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised HIV , said he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had first asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested Lamb himself , with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ ele Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the back@@ stone house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , was head of the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the memorial fe@@ at , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had called the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox joke about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly &apos;s Ministeri@@ al Meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ solu@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have shown in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rise of Her@@ man Cain , none of whom had only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing the pumps accumulated and starting to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans claimed they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about dump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abli@@ shment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans does not see the s@@ ling@@ ing temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans are thinking that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / mail .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their dish@@ on@@ est hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the four of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multip@@ licity of GO@@ P voters will show umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ at@@ tered field probably contributes to the lead , whereas the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l at Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump picks the majority support .
before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , he scored 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a recent C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is the strongest competitor at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; in his election campaign two months ago in Mexico , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will deter His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Mc@@ Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six of ten Republi@@ cans are saying in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ ders than someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ro@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , one square metre of a floor roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbour@@ hoods , however , one of the prices comes from a price like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
tw@@ o@@ fold tor@@ ped@@ o in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a confident pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was awarded the prizes in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership in the Champions League team of Olympic @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a shot of the World Champion as a f@@ lange .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern Munich @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held a word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them well known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) was also proud .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , however , they were often too resour@@ ceful to work .
the attacks were often preceded by a game shift on Link@@ ed@@ usa Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller from the right had more luck than his flan@@ k crashed out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , as Olympic Champion Whis@@ ky Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved on his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bayern did their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
so for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ se@@ ater with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , it &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola chose him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another one .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bav@@ arians in their audience block obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the followers of Munich .
at least one Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium injured .
anyone smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when dispens@@ ing , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times .
the scientists attended more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers wrote in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the hazard again dropped to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ st@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , declared study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health through to old age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
close to the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of construction on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as an office for archae@@ ology .
in the third construction phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists were now well @-@ known .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to heigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which clearly corresponds to more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is said to be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the USA will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
they should come from equal parts of the EU , the USA and from third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent months discussion , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she plans to work on an International Investment Court according to his own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to steal compensation from tax@@ pa@@ yers , to raise national laws or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Economy Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , developed in the spring with other EU Ministers of Trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be un@@ sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ looking fol@@ k@@ singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , wor@@ rying about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Irish .
released in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
it is rum@@ ored that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the US should be held in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ite You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , 2005 is a nationwide masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ ant in ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the amer@@ ican Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs rise , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg city more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the spra@@ w@@ ling St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can thus throw away the &quot; sla@@ b . &quot;
only at an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens says modest , plays a few older songs and finally bows down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s questions with tension has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his dé@@ but at the prime minister &apos;s questions and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six issues shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesman said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stac@@ king &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour was making changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised another policy statement says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from tac@@ kling serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , is represented if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgement of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ ar@@ ism , although critics have argued that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

accelerated Ear@@ nings Growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rapidly increased according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller domain objective .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and most advanced estim@@ ation at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index topped with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % jump after acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sale . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of € 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages threaten expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 years young , a hanging with top @-@ track FR@@ IS@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more and more .
Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is currently in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 is spinning through .
like Wik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the construction of the be@@ aver house : I@@ dol is living here whose poster hangs in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in since Monday evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs just as much a day as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vik@@ toria should sit in the 10th grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber doesn &apos;t .
that has anyway taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ visor , he paid three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company fl@@ ushed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll which looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a cup of coffee you mar@@ vel at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster Br@@ ings to the Pot@@ ato @-@ Greenland Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both are possible - namely in the Pot@@ ato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg company owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the expression &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
in the meantime , the idea of the Lebanese has to be registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
this is why Al@@ hay is not willing to give away how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ a starts campaign for the campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di parade in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia prior to a 700 million $ al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and sell store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual Investor Relations Day .
it is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will grab about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and will take away all available actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s high fixed cost basis could cost some 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to respond publicly to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board of Met@@ a holds contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ to &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has decreased by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction of simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to counter selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholesale market will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Sis@@ gi@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight through the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery skill game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati very soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to hit Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a crash sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am rather en@@ vious is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little dra@@ fted into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the decision of Kyr@@ gy@@ z , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the climb on which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some aw@@ ful mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything aimed at stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants met in a No Man &apos;s Land and Ser@@ b officials responded with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence were hiding for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest to food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to send back migrants from Hungary , while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels did not make a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after closing a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used during the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities were 45 people attempting to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are here to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounds the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to enter .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is firm , what candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choices than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders generated some profits .
Clinton holds a major advance in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton is still ahead of the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month Clinton was in a double @-@ digit margin ahead of the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they wouldn &apos;t support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman president to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den is far away from her second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure decreased from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about eligi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for this vot@@ er to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics among voters of the pres@@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in line with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked during the term as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes on the leader@@ ships .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the rate of failure for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters at the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
the two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted prior to Fox News last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son decreased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also found Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and survi@@ ves Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , published last week , shows Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising up in the past week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tr@@ ump belief .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing lovers is enough to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea might be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water has a maximum of 18 degrees in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) communic@@ ates .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ eful ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brutal during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been stra@@ ined with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen section to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide ro@@ ls and basically set up the welfare of the Brotherhood about Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the ch@@ ic@@ anes since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ es family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a raise of interest is coming , and the land@@ se is fal@@ tered , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was exagger@@ ated because of interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets increases 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to net interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after it ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the growth cycle and the return on returns starts to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
remarkably , the gross domestic product in the vicinity of its lowest point will be at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed all the year to raise the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading will only have a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the raising cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is quicker than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic direction .
in bonds the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often generate better yields in such a climate although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit st@@ acks have wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ates its strategy .
large and large companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded targets by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock sp@@ ins , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers are able to see gains from higher yields , even if experts differ in mind how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ mies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitor when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport to tramp@@ le commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grip The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it started an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to include the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to issue money from the fees pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ ing in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the expenses
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is revers@@ ing , and we may see that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the subsequent turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites over@@ threw .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gain , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that from £ 5 , a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
for some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of partially the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on m@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , supported the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ ch will continue to Mec@@ ca by thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have let the arm of the crane stop when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , falling into a courtyard of the big mo@@ at , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not co @-@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mo@@ cha as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia &apos;s family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a dissi@@ dent son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded give half of that amount .

Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has meanwhile out@@ stri@@ pped .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of the five leading companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has accounted for exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday at the State Court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the pre @-@ examination , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used money from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
he har@@ ms the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial events . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence was to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that the association did not have an asset disadvantage at any point in time .
the sports officials had charged only expense damages and the sports club , for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ basket of large @-@ party audi@@ tors of the financial market .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
moreover , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense damages had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus had been on the account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all inclusive and not detailed bookings appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts and pass@@ books administered the two defend@@ ants together , the other defend@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial statements , it is important to have only been free of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation began because of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Vereins@@ bank account .
that was set@@ backs , the accused explained .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim of damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judges and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he merely calculated mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to demonstrate accurate records for the early years .
these were , according to an operating audit , in which everything was considered correct , they were no longer kept , they declared .
kilometre charge also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the exercises were made in cash , for that purpose he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard puts more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the reduction in staff cuts in the past three years , the Compu@@ Tr@@ ese will reduce further jobs when it comes to split@@ ting the company .
the positions at the US Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs tot@@ aling $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of about $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in the market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share posted 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , which has become a large @-@ scale printer , is currently split into a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a further disap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services , made the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a split@@ ting and massive sub@@ stan@@ cies in the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more transactions online .
all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rep@@ el : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent said appro@@ v@@ ingly .
61 percent are positive in the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
on the other hand , 24 percent are interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian ruler , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed reject 20 percent of respon@@ dents .
29 per cent couldn &apos;t decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
the exhibition will focus on networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility by September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially inaugur@@ ate the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday after two presidential days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent breach of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used illegal refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ craft .
D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k &apos;s Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind them , a police line was formed and a water laun@@ cher was standing behind the police officers .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially deployed pe@@ pper@@ al spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
this dis@@ b@@ anded the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees stuck in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of Dec@@ ision Conc@@ ern@@ ing Inter@@ est Rates for the US National Bank
the world watches when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are lifted or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rose to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of service , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets to adapt to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shiel@@ ds at Delta State University leave ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said the police officer had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb 300 miles sailed to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday the Lamb said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said Lamb had called upon relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb went to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 .
stars who have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly participated in drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year with a better organization alone .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work@@ space .
but there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s trade union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , split the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the event team headed by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , the future will be Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the re @-@ setting , Spo@@ hr stresses the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with whom the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit agreement cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike was stopped .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , cockpit wants to come to yiel@@ ding results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ring concept is the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa puts forward Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ zug to the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the Künstler@@ haus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to the cry and excluded him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic and then it happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno felt happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno broke his leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt his opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes David in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead describes a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text submitted by Cameron is partially reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named young man , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ sw@@ inging , thu@@ dding g@@ ossi@@ p , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times behind a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not rule out a down@@ side victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting deployment , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een develops Ali as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th is out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago Ly@@ th had been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he picks out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t do so well , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first set out Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as the before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to hit mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and would get four Qui@@ cks showed up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps didn &apos;t do his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred clean@@ ers immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari returns to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ den , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights that we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the dressing room , even if the news is in line with what has been said before .

some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = British exit from the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy is sl@@ umped by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , how the EU is now and not always full of own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split allow@@ ances and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they most often do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and George Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Ministers and finance ministers are climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals that no matter whether we are staying or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exc@@ essively long exhau@@ sts as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ sten , who has made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gues , telephone ki@@ ppers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him , instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put down the principle of the non @-@ passed constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I put it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ ass tendency and the wild cli@@ mes of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the Cor@@ by@@ n bottom @-@ up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true Cameron doesn &apos;t give a free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stat@@ ute Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi@@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to give their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the outcomes of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Instrument ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to get funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of members of the board are not supplied , but includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
tobacco was held by P@@ he at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the statements of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we satisfy our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former chef of Channel 4
former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should cease sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for placing them publicly @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which are clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to pay the fee , what I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or put into order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt for evaluations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one cannot measure rather the audience , but they can argue when they go to their seemingly sacred missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio charge Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if that &apos;s right because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the Tuesday Committee called for BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that little of BBC production would now be officially clas@@ sed as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and go into alliances with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified ne@@ ural systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane can@@ als that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms revealed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ de@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
gour@@ mets usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ de@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ de@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
if he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; stated Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which can be seen at bus stops and metro trains and require a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important notice : do you go to the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) reads names of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into a picture of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September , a flock of weapons dealers will run with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers will be asked to assist in stopping the weapons trade show .
the 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work in the museum of gru@@ es@@ ome designs in Bank@@ sys disp@@ l@@ aces .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they must go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapon mass - by a empt@@ ying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and shad@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ eness of bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors have fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have made angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ sounding complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat@@ ting : people tell wh@@ ence you come from if and where you &apos;ve taken the sab@@ bath year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ mite do not love or hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people know .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places on which people attract attention and under@@ line their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I gave you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel bound to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people feel sleep@@ y when they knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a washing @-@ up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent human being , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more l@@ ousy music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move to the same residence hall ?
on the other hand , if you are a room@@ mate for your future spouse , would like to take care of her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she re@@ treats all of her friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your sub@@ lei@@ gh a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people who do not have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single mother and the low wage ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build today still cheap and good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds rice houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
given the stream of refugees , we also need adequate living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly dra@@ fted my project .
the threat of Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ mere special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l Ord@@ in@@ ance makes it particularly complicated .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
it is still under@@ represented , who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ servant .
I show how to build today still cheap and well .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Setup App &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by mer@@ ging the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worth not@@ ing that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a down@@ turn in the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only Dev@@ ise : full Attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton is just another motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup leader stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and won the Fl@@ ut@@ lan@@ t Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on could win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who kept himself in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to include chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent finding are also to be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the sen@@ iors &quot; centre Anton@@ ella joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation runs it down from the hill to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and care insur@@ ers .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff to ensure that their relatives are often left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the benefits of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isi@@ ft and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as stroke prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement Centre for Care and Care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders are seeing the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this requires a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the neighborhood office also dedic@@ ates itself to club satur@@ ation : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gather@@ ng . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because flood games have a special attraction .
in the turn of the last 16 teams the FC One @-@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg retired in 2010 through victories in the district sli@@ des@@ ist 1 . FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the regional gi@@ sts 1 . FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist house announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus awarded an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna during and after the Second World War at Friedrich Leh@@ mann .

parking : Tim Wiese thri@@ lls polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was noticed ung@@ utely in Bremen .
once upon a time , there was Tim Wiese , former National Guard in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not give up on the other hand .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the inner city of Bremen , when he saw a parking space gu@@ ardian laid out a ticket for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a meadow swa@@ yed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and threw it in front of her feet , like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether the meadow will be shown or not .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters from the police and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck them with the fist .
the victim suffered from the nose @-@ leg and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the rac@@ quets , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the off@@ ender followed the group with a passenger car to the apartment and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured man went out of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ ig@@ h were applied under the aid of a strike pole .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
until now only a vag@@ ue t@@ act description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ vern@@ ausen .
furthermore , the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are pleased about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lacking luck : on October 1 , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rocky breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the next few months .
Müller opens the practice on October 12 , after a reconstruction phase , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the work of the field met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently undergoing her professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of managing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future was the couple Müller .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish b@@ unk@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the tw@@ o@@ fold father of the family Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz &apos;s district and is involved in voluntary service in the DRC &apos;s readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ vern@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both intern@@ ist , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
the Müll@@ ers will receive a grant of 50@@ 000 Euros within the scope of a sponsor@@ ship programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
in 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , enter the practice of Fel@@ vern@@ ausen every quarter , in the northern German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of Frank Müller &apos;s practical tak@@ eover : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stops ausen .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers talk lesson also still look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock @-@ standing .
with their departure ends an era in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ vern@@ ausen with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , she feels a little sad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees live by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also taken up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an application for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the care and safety of people is the main priority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to not seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees have already tried to arrive in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
she was able to attack the Croatian police in nearby corn fields .
according to local media , ever since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country is counting about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far , would agree with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it to instruc@@ t people to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling the whole night from the approximately 500 @-@ kilometre @-@ distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did so , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ located route could now actually come to the fore by observers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , stressed earlier that his country had prepared plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees for potential emergency situations .
he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive border control options . &quot;
strict controls are conducted in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since carried out a good report on the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two fron@@ tier cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not be a matter of very high numbers of refugees at this time .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ der shops on the financial markets should have been made with the captured information . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ oning Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a bu@@ stling operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

with this action the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously access the chal@@ k and read the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet , &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that for me eventually the end comes to this world , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is jointly sponsored by the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence this public effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still stuck with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people .

when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid sought an honorary doctor , she immediately reported to herself and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - the victims and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with their task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training , training and supervision of the funeral and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .

F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit forecast for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in the e @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to Ear@@ n a Win between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Company , analysts expected $ 10,@@ 84 .
the lower view , despite the price increases , will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business yields solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor power , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was earning $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted T@@ ack &apos;s 12 analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts ordered six analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , bringing sales in its unit expe@@ di@@ ted shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ ging sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at one end of the projected two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the nation against all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les itself on the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy continued to sustain the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise of interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the sentence is expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world drew together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors argued that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the May peak .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when interest rates are to be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US National Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell said , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ aters , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who stands for a raise raise , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market sl@@ ump in 2008 , said Mr S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of increasing interest rates because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I do not think it should rush in time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she also likes to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there , she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good diet is during lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck up breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ h@@ out building at the Bern@@ ese Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest community session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the Panel had approved , among other things , an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ carrying first and roof sur@@ facing should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the ti@@ lt , which is meant to lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the ti@@ lt of the roof - whereby the municipal council usually dec@@ lines more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this is not a recur@@ rent project when it comes to gym building : &quot; in this way , we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger explains .
the gymnas@@ tics hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected by Schul@@ - and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ing .
in the next step , the application for the 18 x 36 meters hall will now be presented to the District Office for consideration .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the surprising plans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hospital Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the district of Land@@ kreis before , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , which will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who will succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case and a distribution of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station for gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to perform both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
Land@@ Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met sc@@ ents that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ap@@ schaft , will be used as shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property goes on , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again and again threatened by closure in the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason to be arrogan@@ t .

Jag@@ night@@ fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use as the police shared .
after a gun@@ shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were put into hospitals .
at first it was unclear how exactly this could lead to the accident .
the criminal police investigated .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , is also deemed to have been suspected and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ained claimed to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to death .
the further investigations are said to bring about the closer circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of the German housing market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Ac@@ ci@@ dent Buil@@ dings .
by comparison , in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany .
thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also highlights significant reductions in residential housing policies in recent years .
Germany is shooting down a deficit that grows larger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0.000 housing units have already been missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study .
for this reason , many working people lived in large cities in need of room@@ mate shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily more in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
thus the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well on the agenda for cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at 18@@ 4 million euros , on Monday evening , more than half of the available 300 million euros was rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia address corridor
there is practically no passing to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing their way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia through the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived in Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which came into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , it &apos;s women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media re@@ port@@ edly came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived by bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees are not at the border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines left from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before closing on Monday we had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian legislation sets out the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted were sentenced to prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established Tran@@ sit@@ e@@ ons , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , forty refugees had stopped there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian terms , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier bars were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to government figures .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor passed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel buyers at the entrance to the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it ended in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had only once su@@ cked the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said we brought them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train passengers , who had been str@@ anded on Sunday evening in W@@ els , had switched from one ICE to a regional train towards Passa@@ u , to try it after the announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still across the border .
but the regional train was shut down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a second brid@@ ge@@ head sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly rel@@ a@@ yed the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude to the dun@@ st of Naz@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she welcomed and welcomed , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and approaching winter , to make decent conditions for protection seekers in us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all the hands to do with the teaching of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first tak@@ eover centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already managed to get a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts last year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s fine in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator uses great expectations also in the ORF &quot; Help like us . &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that neighbour@@ hoods have to respect a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful in accommodation , founded Konrad in his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further notice of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not contributing to the Republic as they themselves stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , our own mapping search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with the approval .
Linz demands a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for placing refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to do so without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for emer@@ gen@@ cies , other sites should be checked for suit@@ ability .
criticism is committed to the partition of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a prolonged telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday correspon@@ ded further proceedings in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ er would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing checks to its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lin@@ zer &apos;s industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the Technology Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smart minds are our raw material in IT - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on which to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , € 3.@@ 3m from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to move this project without further ado : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop compared to the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were pleased with the idea of their own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz harbour that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also not answer the expert woman with last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is valu@@ ing every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ du@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate An@@ c@@ est@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
some people also associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for the upright .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , obj@@ ection@@ able to journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presi@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ oun@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place are related to him over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the gang of K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one Wen@@ del shot a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed a humor@@ ous documentary about the place and his famous children , among whom besides Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a loc@@ ale for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly refused to talk about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative d@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the Americans dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always so da@@ zzling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ y@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .

in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a reserve .

Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the reviews of today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull succeeded in making Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s down@@ fall .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the crash seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five capitals , in comparison with today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 by Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial port of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ael , Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without Raf@@ ael star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 bis 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe resulted in an average of 44@@ 6.000 fans .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly reveal who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was covered in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked out with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally added an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood was the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game corruption who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed energies ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m ready for him now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom wood should choose , if not she , she was mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s b@@ achel@@ or will be on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his career in FL .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a tie as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the mill in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his mess@@ y catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Victoria &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the fo@@ aming and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get b@@ ashing in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday faction of the Free elec@@ torate ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually , quite different main subjects were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also domin@@ ating the free elec@@ torate summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as during the 1990s during the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing deb@@ tor remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Pa@@ eh@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot test &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the upper @-@ secondary school is tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools we want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
reinforced Wall Street assi@@ sts Da@@ x on le@@ aps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German stock market has closed with profits after a long @-@ haul and nervous trading trend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in the afternoon was a strong start to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X of medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Eurozone &apos;s Euro@@ shock 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s leading index declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also boo@@ sted trade places in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index stated last around 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock exchanges expect the markets to enter the market until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the big decline on the stock exchange on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left their mark on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government has denied the figures stated in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , ultimately losing 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Infin@@ eon shares climbed by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the Da@@ x Peak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the papers of the automobile companies Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s mer@@ its increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on exchange of listed German securities declined to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Rex index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
in the afternoon , the price of the euro fell to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at noon , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 People killed after police shoot rubber missi@@ les on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used , which are known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rid@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western part of Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuild .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is no concrete offer yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you have to wait for appropriate offers , it means on the part of the city .
which investor is in@@ quired , is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Road , bought some months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , greeted , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement near Em@@ den on the table near Em@@ den .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ press Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends proc@@ eeded from the system @-@ building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been in discussion for months at about ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting shou@@ ted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea , and a board member representing the winners of the winners , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is going to be a huge block that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , like several other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ loads must come in order to calculate that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dup@@ lication campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusual personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ ze the donations call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / substantially increased to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery for type 2 diabetes has proven efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan made Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c scar@@ ring - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes condition disappeared completely and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , the diabetes was completely reduced by only one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood glucose level in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher intake in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years in obes@@ e people who tried to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conven@@ tionally @-@ based methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot accommodate all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mira@@ bly ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama engaged Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ rup@@ ed increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swallow highly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 , reporting the poison control centres , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some children have deliberately drow@@ ning dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection just because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency center at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky standing around , but people leave these hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was put into emergency treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors sur@@ passed them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant clo@@ ths and to store hand dis@@ infection products out of the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision at the cross @-@ p@@ liers between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ p@@ liers in the direction of the industrial zone and realized too late that at the round@@ about two preceding vehicles had stopped .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ involved vehicles , material damage was incurred by approximately 10,000 euros , divi@@ des the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer mobile and had to be tow@@ ed .
rum@@ ors : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic

D@@ ons increase lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours of disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which von Griff@@ i@@ ths has spontaneously refused . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic matches more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ à accepts that Celtic fight has to fight , but the Norwegian chef di@@ gs to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , now with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly like this - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .

despite his comments , just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he r@@ ushed out some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark Var@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new entries and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with trace@@ ability
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not aboli@@ shed the de@@ mis@@ e from Wales this summer .

the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent off the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the defender &apos;s Red Card was later rev@@ oked - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the incident happened in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added : &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ io &apos;s Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but acknow@@ le@@ dges that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton &apos;s policies to win a seventh consecutive league victory , which gave them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases overall in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland stayed unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole increased from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the share of Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the figures from the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
during these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the sequence

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see Exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery happens to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying for an unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase to persu@@ ade to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a breach of the peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them to the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins went his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid drinking alcohol and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race sport .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly cling to their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it &apos;s going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave fei@@ gn@@ ed and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to license my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about .
but I &apos;ve arrived at the point that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the training levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e@@ ject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his license above the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation for the failed Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of the horse , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation into this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy s@@ lam back against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; w@@ rest@@ ling &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team agreed confi@@ dently , as it felt that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up and down again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this shows up again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 dollars deposit after drug delivery
a man who may face a life @-@ long punishment because of his temp@@ er to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ length punishment for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to own the whole crowd and that in the café could have been harmless .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has a clear relationship with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ate declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , noti@@ fies himself with the police daily and stops at an initial block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved were bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker has completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone by girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log@@ gged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im ple@@ aded that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in pre @-@ trial detention for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders even before the date of the judgment .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off@@ side the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers resulted from fear of discovery and arrest the people increased at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in the administrative districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs .
there they are received by Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to federal police data , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
some 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong point was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tropical storm , which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea circle with bu@@ o@@ ys from 60 to 90 km kilometres .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the mass is making it : every two years the car manufacturers show their new products at the IA@@ A .
in 2015 , this is mainly due to movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to become much more expensive .
Opel is one of the biggest competitors in the VW Golf segment , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what &apos;s going on next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only to be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then also as a Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan ou@@ trigger wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court justified an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was held in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
the decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a solitary cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his position of office due to the un@@ worthy conditions of his arrest against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of confin@@ ement were author@@ it@@ ative for the compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a loss of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
thus they only spoke in April of a prisoner of damages , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 to certi@@ fy a decent housing .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time had been accommod@@ ated between 15 to 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin have also come head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
therefore , det@@ ain@@ ees are trapped again and again 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even with ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Press Office , 21 bodies in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of junior staff , 19 are expected to fall in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees according to the statements of Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a resolution in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments yearly - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , especially for affordable rental objects , is dramatic : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing vac@@ ate from the rent for rent , and refugees are also applying for these particularly favorable housing .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing estates would have to rise every year and for this the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Government agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says immigration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thr@@ u@@ hardt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there has been a political revers@@ al : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while previously there was a ban on labour for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence requirement to restrict the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view of the shortage of skilled workers has become more and more established that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ hardt , the royal road to labour integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ eing parents give their children to the put@@ ties , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ aring parents it is important first of all to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ etter , Spo@@ kes@@ person for Youth and Family in the Senate Administration in Berlin .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is rising greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students willing to study could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they start a study .
the latter basically do not get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ici@@ le people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span shor@@ tens to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , so Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get b@@ af@@ o@@ gs immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include obligations .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this includes prepar@@ edness to tackle religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to expose such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and an universal equality law since a decade ago .
but it is very slowly learning how the NS@@ U murder series showed in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans already demand for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism conflict in Germany are committed must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees that have been waiting so far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says District President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacity is concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards .
provided services could be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cast off so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum application law stipul@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors first of all make language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are inferior to their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV awareness .
with the partial other disease pictures , German physicians come from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and regarding the lack of doctors , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , and a number of refugees are even physicians .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer &#91; B@@ P@@ t@@ K &#93; : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by the TU München confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , says Mun@@ z .
until now , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices may submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not educated for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege encourages to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst acc@@ esses the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group by captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal traits and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick , was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current stage staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for lovers is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cu@@ ban cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst on his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to hold up loos@@ ely .
ease and agi@@ lity - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
except through numerous salmon reserves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
serp@@ ent people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its agi@@ lity .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst puts a comment on this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , is read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel good , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the top priority : to provide good care for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with my whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances every day from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe leads wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread through social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by MPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them about accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
in the past month , they had pro@@ str@@ ated him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in Parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to replace 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage has been called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure made by HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the belief that tightly focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says te@@ amm@@ ate must face the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided that his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a big issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight play@@ time since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs who recorded most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an an@@ alog@@ ous time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with a magnitude of 3.2 being measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains committed by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football watching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone chap@@ la@@ ins explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his death against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , passing by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani maintained course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion in the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , in the A group , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it not only seeks the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was completed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ prints and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi saw a goal at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game from them !
Glen@@ core ga@@ thers $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , which is affected by the fall in raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the London registered company Glen@@ core stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights led to a rapid rise in the London Stock Exchange .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group &apos;s shares .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
on Tuesday morning , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight .
the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
the most recent newcom@@ er is a six @-@ month @-@ old girl from Syria .
the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats @-@ D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the statement adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will likely meet in Seattle several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues including Washington &apos;s concerns about alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern in 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern clearly stood before the obligation of Spain super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion Champions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 in front of the farewell from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid has won anything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the Bayern Munich .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for it works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça did contract Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and ended the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ took to emphas@@ ise the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress by The Mar@@ tian encouraged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white stallion .
the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film direction rights ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO MU@@ CH that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et comp@@ eted more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
as the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement has achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured inclu@@ sions .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums quiet matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge at full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad E@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit punc@@ tured three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to close this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BC@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first tri@@ ke hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ tis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh round , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished ning with a double on the left field line .
right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Du@@ cks to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen put the third ba@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play .
it was the major 27 times this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after adding an insurance run at the end of the ninth interior , she made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hand @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
at the start of the game Detroit benefited from an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play , who was making a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success series with runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third ba@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throw school@@ ers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three target field games on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are supposed to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden during Tuesday evening .
they expected 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily go underground there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
alone over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived at the Hessen Higher Regional Council responsible for the initial up@@ take of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds a military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute contempl@@ ation of military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective vis@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be returned to Hungary either .
also Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call any concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) in a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee shipping in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you do not have a lead @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this opinion was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort to force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
on Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from looking for ev@@ asive routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ nat@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ gers slightly on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; in 2006 at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ill water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tory injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a great loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a non @-@ registered professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties , however , initially presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to enter running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
contrary to initial ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions , he remained without a serious scale .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat fruits thus support sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS will again provide up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all drivers are sought .
last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 workers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries made the package services harsh criticism .
first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland , on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night of Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness through the herd sire .
on Thursday morning we are crossing a striking cold front , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n winds its way through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows on Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ ne valleys with ar@@ cs of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the border of the Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my weather @-@ dri@@ er for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the alpine hill@@ side .
here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , depending on the size of the rain in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow comes off , as a result a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east is rolling through Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind is blowing strongly up to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures fall significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north gra@@ vely with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honored as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible , that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he found the city back then as a perfect sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions were probably encouraged by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the wholesale trade .
hammer Artist invested three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the major works Ot@@ mar Alt made for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ am@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite som@@ bre .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on topics like clo@@ ist@@ ers , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he has been fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages that were chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into today , into the present contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible quotation and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his own personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this gives the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
in the end , emotions were triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant mi@@ stress Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an up@@ bringing with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on that , in order to be able to do so again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art become more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have a different delight and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work on them , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ am@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I didn &apos;t pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but also selected the themes that were important to him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ am@@ ost : &quot; here we are about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching
plans made , place , companies commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured d@@ oom , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill scre@@ ened , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break @-@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the increasing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they take the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes on everyone , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do football league , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig addressed a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing societies had started their own projects in their places would be great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO is losing an eye in accident
head of Chief of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a down@@ fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight , he fell onto a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again if you fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of combat ...

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high stress of its pros , k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his stem position on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of headquarters in Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
in probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche announcement of fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance of picking up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic car : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the German federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner when it comes to changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who will also meet with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio .
a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use around an international level that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour is raised .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ een the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonom@@ ously driving cars , 33 per cent in the USA .
in any case , drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Association of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
on the free@@ way , the traffic @-@ flowing traffic could be 15 percent , while the traffic jam is 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of Düsseldorf , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company will only open in singles from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said federal trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point in time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who headed the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League match at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven the defender was met by a Tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights are display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been carried out : in order to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the Senator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the designer &apos;s first , delicate fashion attempts .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed up his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them .
for his first show he won &apos;t be able to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a larger role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is borrow@@ ed from past embroi@@ der@@ ies , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut away .
there is almost no more private specialty shops and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer said about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , high @-@ quality and innovative products must be found .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter was revi@@ ving the historic snow ball point .
at the same time , the machine stops small balls at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca Har@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ itz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a souvenir .
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to watch a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el , which plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
whoever plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more widely for the world
the economy must open wide out@@ war@@ dly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , said Xi .
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance since it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally binding business environment and more open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attor@@ neys &apos; right to exercise their activity and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ or fish and to help consumers expect a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received an appropriate working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force on pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already poll@@ uted with mercury so much that approximately 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limits .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , like car@@ p are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ one @-@ fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly abundant in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in cases of un@@ born babies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and region@@ ally exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
