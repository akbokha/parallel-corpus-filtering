Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington den@@ oun@@ ces Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor is admitted to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note wrapped on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point after that .
until the end of the day , there was another death : he took the life when the police arrived at him .
a day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and were jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the memorial watch , while the University door &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there was no indication that the two had ever married .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of arms away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected movie theaters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ lasting conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ solu@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have shown in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tears of stamina and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first state election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is evidence that a large number of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to lead to lead , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support harv@@ ests .
in front of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio , 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for dr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration issues .
so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to be doing it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with experience in government .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally anger@@ ed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ o@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea resort .
in the street , one square meter of a street roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which specific locations a square meter will cost most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top camper places , however , the price of pe@@ an@@ uts comes before .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking list of most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ ment@@ e in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to earn a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bavaria a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the Champions League in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his 28 hits at the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s lead to the good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who left a f@@ lange @-@ covered shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Phil@@ lip Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the King &apos;s class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , however , they were often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on Link@@ ed@@ usa Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , as Olympic champion Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ alie Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians preferred to play their dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola chose him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the nearby Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another one .
before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with blows against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when dispens@@ ing , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health through to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of teeth affected the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of the late anti@@ quity from Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer .
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of construction on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as an office for archae@@ ology ground conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists were now found five .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs , probably belonging to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
to raise the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the United States will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts of the EU , the USA and from third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , but there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she plans to work on an International Investment Court according to his own specifications .
there may also be clari@@ fication of disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by ad@@ versaries as a sort of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , over which companies claim damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the timi@@ dly acting fol@@ ks@@ singer the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Irish .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever@@ ly composed songs , which harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into a great opul@@ ent .
it is rum@@ ored that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a twisted series : each of the 50 states should be held in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece was published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styli@@ sti@@ cal fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual net list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after highly productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long since the smaller clubs came up , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ piece band .
in the dark ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although there are now nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; sla@@ b in essence . &quot;
only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question with tension is expected .
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , aims to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questions and for the first time put himself in with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six issues shortly after lunch , where his performance is likely to be reviewed by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs in the newspapers during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported it as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stac@@ king &quot; within Labour as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference said that Labour is propos@@ ing to remove the whole idea of limiting a total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ co , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will have both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with hooks and has instead made a focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the Shadow Econom@@ ist , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theater &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the majority of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data , which showed an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and has been inv@@ alu@@ able since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % jump after acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher sal@@ aries end@@ anger the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber itself does not .
this has anyway taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ visor he paid three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company sp@@ ammed many , many dollars to the bank account .
and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber is also cas@@ c@@ ading .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster takes care of the Lebanese to the Pot@@ ato @-@ Greenland idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and indeed in the Pot@@ ato @-@ ön@@ er developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ k owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served with meat and potatoes in its shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been submitted to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
this is why Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ a La@@ un@@ ches Ground Defense Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ case
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and equipment carry out its annual investors strategy day .
it is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will start 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , down 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted last week .
i@@ GA@@ S &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that in 2017 , the wholesale merchant will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to hit Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ er sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am pretty angry about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little dra@@ gged into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os on the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent member into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a country strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc with a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after closing a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the boundary or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the military use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are planning to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos sur@@ passed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and sting a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more independent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders generated some gains .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support among the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders only with@@ stands 5 points here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big advantage in older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the election nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reserves and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with the problems and the voters are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den is far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results with some important features in voters of the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be placed as an Foreign Minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent can see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible households also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes with guidance .
from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rate of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ cra@@ cies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
the two candidates now have half the support of the voters in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and was sur@@ passing Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the fault margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
taking a look at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week has a maximum of 18 degrees , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a j@@ esting ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , leading to his death , reported the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the community began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle via the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries .
following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates are coming , and the land@@ se will be fu@@ elled , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could see that all the fuss might have been exagger@@ ated because of interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to net interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will be likely to occur later in the growth cycle and the return will begin to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate the recession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP had been nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whe@@ ther it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made themselves a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all revi@@ ving cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en rapidly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic direction .
in bonds , the returns appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in the interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and large segment , companies operating the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 exceeded 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the stock market , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to the public &apos;s live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and commissioned new works , I think really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element in BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins seized The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to an entertainment series next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to include the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to issue money from the fee agency for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday may be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bored , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that happens , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the res@@ ounding sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites over@@ threw .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia de@@ parts the collapse of partially the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ cha .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their final journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial when the Saudi King sent a san@@ ction to the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ cha of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Mr. Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man hoped to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal decree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ cha as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crane crash occurred amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded give half of this amount .

the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has seen an increase in
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , are opened .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong nowadays to a minority .
the British employ more and more craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 retail outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ mand@@ ed her top team to reflect a number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has just 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group owed the costs for closing the shops .
King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q features 200 new stores due to the trends .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball field master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and assignment ev@@ asion on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants used funds from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial van@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time the association had ar@@ isen an in@@ adver@@ tent .
the sports officials had calculated only expenses and the sports club , for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ sive pas@@ sions amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread profession , told the finance department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to safeguard our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
moreover , in case of corresponding financial success , the pa@@ yout of the expense allowance has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was on the account .
this is why Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
the two defend@@ ants jointly administered the accounts and accounts , said the second accused .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial services , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this securities account went to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally thought that he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the public prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the society had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never related a cent salary , he merely calculated mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to demonstrate accurate documentation for the early years .
these are , according to an operational audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer kept , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant was also related to mile@@ age .
all the exercises are made in cash , in order to do so , he said in his statement from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard puts more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer will disman@@ tle more jobs when split@@ ting the company .
the sub@@ positions at the US computer H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) find no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of approximately $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent .
the company based in Pal@@ o Alto , a large @-@ scale print company , is currently split up : the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again disap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters were returned .
HP answers with a split@@ ting and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops on @-@ line .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , be largely rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , and 35 percent were con@@ sent@@ ing .
61 percent positive that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian government , Bach@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rej@@ ecting 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .

after two days of press release , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility Connect &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Automobile Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water laun@@ chers against several hundred displaced refugees at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ zi@@ k has witnessed the break @-@ out at the border control point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and behind the police officers stood ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially deployed pe@@ pper@@ ed spray spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees sack@@ ed themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokesman of the Serbian police suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
the time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
the world watches when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest will be lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will hold interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior associate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty view of global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death guard at the Delta State University leaving ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note by Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , escaped on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ law gives on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no management board for the passenger business in future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the event team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the new order under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike was stopped .
this divided the union with .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , cockpit wants to come to sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ring concept is the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be seen that the Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defender to the crying and excluded him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to take Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 film version , adding the new characters and details to bro@@ aden the pretty short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , one boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not susp@@ icious enough : the text submitted by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , thri@@ fty beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twenty times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Camer@@ o@@ onian elections bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s squ@@ ad , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ tro@@ phy .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even though he did not do so well , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and would get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he opened in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred re@@ els immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights that we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the dressing room even if the news is in line with what is said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain momentum when the economy reaches a sl@@ ump in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ planned new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y . &quot; is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , is now and not always full of debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photograph of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , looking for Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long exhau@@ sts like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they are getting a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has not gained anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ac@@ ons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak@@ ly reminiscent of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ cas , most of our big newspapers own .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but he noticed that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you would be better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put down the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his back door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday on Monday - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ass tendency and the wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admitted that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports at their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the mess@@ y bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and tre@@ ach@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday about something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage caused by different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously reported by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are included , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he participated in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the statements made by BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which are also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcast fee , what I think medi@@ um- or long @-@ term is not for a good idea , you should at least focus on programs that others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt for evaluations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC indicate what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billions of radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the committee on Tuesday called for BBC to examine their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pulses operate through switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
if he uses ultras@@ onic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light emit@@ ted by an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

in September , a flock of arms dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers will be asked to assist in stopping the weapons trade fair .
the 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters sal@@ utes the commuters on the underground .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was astonished about the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapon fair - through a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ing with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a drop in the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapon fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors will dev@@ ote fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have offen@@ ded - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to sne@@ ak : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , if and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ mite do not love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not talk even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places on which people attract attention and get their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I &apos;ve spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel bound to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a washing @-@ up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lau@@ tern music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she draws together all of her friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your sub@@ lei@@ surely a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not closed room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never worry someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single mothers , small children
the estate contractor Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor builds in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds a project of town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
given the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly dra@@ gged my project correctly .
it is especially difficult to make the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch ordin@@ ance .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
it is still under@@ represented , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is definitely not true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a crash of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who has more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that chairman Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players that cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search will also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ovi@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations you can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation runs down from the hill to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
recently a new district office was opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you immediately get sen@@ iors and advice for advice on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nursing homes .
for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the benefits of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ wife Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isi@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as tor@@ sion prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senior Center for Care and Care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this requires a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ operation . &quot;
this gives the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9@@ am to 2@@ pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ lights have a special appeal .
in the turn of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg retired in 2010 by victories in the district League 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Region@@ alli@@ gi@@ sts 1st FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 @-@ years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus also left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz into the Austrian Theatre Museum .
parking fine : Tim Wiese raises polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , former National Guard in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not listen intellectu@@ ally .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the inner city , when he saw a parking space guard out there for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese burst out of the business , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and accused her of the counter@@ fei@@ ting of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
the alle@@ gations are confirmed by the city of Bremen , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether the meadow is displayed or not .

men complain to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the petrol station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck them with the fist .
the victim suffered a nose break and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the wounded went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of a strike stick , one was beating on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ors to report at the number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , Bernd Bor@@ mann , Mayor of Economic Research , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lacking luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first sight , when the fel@@ lows came to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing her professional training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the garbage cans bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , following his medical studies in Hannover , followed by several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both intern@@ s , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be granted to the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen every quarter , in the northern German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another home doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of Frank Müller &apos;s practical tak@@ eover : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers consultations , by the way , continue to look at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the field of rock .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already feels it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself to gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an application for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police managed to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , ever since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees .
it is mainly concerned with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in action .
in the coming days , his country is counting about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it would be the people to propose specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day other buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did so , so the police said we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the shift in the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary has already predicted a somewhat further west @-@ located route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are conducted to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently made a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of Home N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be about very high refugee figures .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are still not even cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators were given a total of over 100 million dollars .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

while some pass@@ ers spontaneously to the chal@@ k and read the proposition for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; others can stop &quot; war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again , small discussions about the action are developing , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear to myself that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der Ö@@ cum@@ en@@ ische Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a winning between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected $ 10,@@ 84 million according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging transports of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research questioned analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six analysts expected $ 12,@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping which brought net sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased 29 per cent while bo@@ oting , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares decreased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
on its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at an end of the adorned , two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight in order to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and be it only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uncertain .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy continues to uph@@ old the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence is expected .
although creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , where D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation as to when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke at that time in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow their monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements linked with apparently not the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
var@@ nish@@ ing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest rates , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives did not undo these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market sl@@ ump in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest statement .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where she fears of interest rates because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany for these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the dedication of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 courses .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS is trying to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good diet is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out of the stadium on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint session , the elabor@@ ated construction request was unanim@@ ously lowered without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously agreed on a legislative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ enclosed first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - was stipul@@ ated differently from the construction plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan was not allowed for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the a@@ version of the roof - whereby the municipal council usually is rather restric@@ tive for exemp@@ tion jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project when it comes to turn@@ out building : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymnas@@ tics hall building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and wide sports sponsor@@ ship .
in the next process step , the application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ wide hall will now be presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as a new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to have both houses until next year the former hospital in the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the district had planned this for 2018 , if the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ scar@@ ce , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ sp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ ins of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .

Jag@@ dun@@ ce with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were employed as the police shared .
after a gun@@ shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday night , is considered to be a suspect , and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not arrived at home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
during interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mis@@ chief , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ained claimed to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
the further investigations are intended to provide information about the circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the German housing market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Assembly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many of them come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a public deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metro@@ politan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities in need of shared flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were un@@ willing to stay longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the exposure of the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved on the property tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well underway in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been called up on Monday evening with a total of 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
in Hungary there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees broke out to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day , Hungary sealed its border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of the media reports say from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived by bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach Croatia by foot over the green border .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border fence .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clean@@ ers are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before closure on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threaten jail sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; set up on the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian terms , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was at the end of W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossing the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first met the un@@ hoped guests , with a snack and a drink .
we have just said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were moved to a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to make it possible after the announcement that the railway line was shut down to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ leg@@ ged run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical conclusion of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis des National@@ socialism .
supporting these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in which decent conditions for protection seekers are to be produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof qu@@ arti@@ s
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has a lot to do with the support of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad lived that his word has weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first tak@@ eover centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ el@@ essness in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the year @-@ old year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should it be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
these would have promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s fine in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that neighbour@@ hoods need to maintain a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in accommodation , founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the republic as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
up to now , our own map search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accom@@ o@@ date refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected are currently without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , other sites should be checked for suit@@ ability .
the head of the city is critici@@ zed by the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ des further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ ing is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is rented from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I am most pleased when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also not answer the specialist woman with last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for you .
whether he expresses himself in a hostile attitude to journalists , or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presi@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hair@@ dresser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place are related to it over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , among whom besides Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) as well - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the story of Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a ta@@ vern for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundations of the real estate group were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , in which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative dr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma was a born trou@@ pe , the op@@ a was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension lady Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ ede@@ vil@@ s , even in the USA aw@@ akes the interest .
the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ried to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the reviews for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ montage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today &apos;s average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of the Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ael Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 came .

the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly reveal who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , finally landing at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before three two get checked , you may have accidentally added an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game corrupt who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls equally - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a tie as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also strengthened Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his sc@@ rap@@ ed catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Journ@@ alists &apos; Land@@ tag inquiry is held in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e until Friday .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free elec@@ torate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting torch is on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stand plus &quot; at 47 gymnas@@ tics , with which an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um mid @-@ level of three is tested for three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to the Abit@@ ur .
but that &apos;s not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that we want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear immediately why the rubber shells used , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as less fatal alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ he@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor is eligible for , is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , just a few months ago and had to tear down the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for a holiday resort on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor presented plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure room
for months , behind closed doors negotiated , greeted , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the Little Sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends of the system @-@ building management went on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
for months , this project has been in discussion for some ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant ring that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , as a number of other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come in order that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches dup@@ lication campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( Google Inc . ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing support for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war rav@@ aged Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an edi@@ tori@@ als for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan made Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was totally and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely reduced by only one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher degrees in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have associated with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we aren &apos;t like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swallow a strong alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand des@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children are reluct@@ ant to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant just because of a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let a si@@ p whis@@ ky stand around , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ame her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ y@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases via alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing the disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the secret plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a collision at the cross@@ bar between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was easily injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and was too late to notice that two vehicle driving vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta before .
in the case of the accident involving vehicles , damage to property amounted to about 10,000 euros , the police reported .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer dri@@ ve@@ able and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about Dis@@ harmony at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no more highlights of Celtic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m Games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ amp to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , now with five points ahead , clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic has had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it just like that - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments , just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he hur@@ ried a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new additions and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season &apos;s time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Target person Mich@@ u with Re@@ duc@@ tions
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .

the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later revers@@ ed - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but it states that the decline has to end on the playing field .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen fought desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league match giving them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in po@@ k@@ ies or le@@ agues , the games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the United Kingdom overall .
unemployment in Scotland stayed unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Schot@@ t@@ &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as showed the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the procedure

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
something later today , except for late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places available , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have better articul@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can turn .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying for unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase persu@@ aded to come out of the c@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he ski@@ pped the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too excited about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .

in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins left his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards are trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the race and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long sat on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously left the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - which I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly take their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave as cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now considering them .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have been established with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; e@@ ject &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ finished Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s legs , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fighting back
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that at the Tac@@ kling they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we did not change anything in our defensive system or the techniques all year round . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles on a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how it appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a sh@@ ot@@ gun .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters game scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the final round at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guaran@@ tee on Dru@@ gs
a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America on Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ length penalty for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ist explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , noti@@ fies himself with the police daily and stops at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
during a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three trucks took part in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 pm .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of them and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of viol@@ ating in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year , and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the verdict .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up at the border control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers resulted from fear of discovery and arrest the people increased to smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the federal police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Land@@ kreise of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Station in comparison to the start of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .

on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , there is a trend in the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models are presented in this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel launches its entry below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a sporty GT version .

the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers first put their hands on the front part : here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was especially moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants are added at the IA@@ A in the compact class , such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison Te@@ gel prison , which was held in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates basically claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was once again on the open , had moved to a larger cell .
his position of office due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
but the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and returned the case to the re@@ trial there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , it was said that there was an equ@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
thus they only spoke in April of a prisoner of damage because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , in addition to Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed on a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior lack , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the report by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a resolution in light of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic but especially for affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 housing units fall out of the rental price , and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable housing .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to develop and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Government agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the compulsory duty to asylum seekers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view prevailed , which should allow refugees to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the creation of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the King &apos;s Way to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few orph@@ aned parents give birth to their children in the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ uted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is rising sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepar@@ atory refugees could be facilit@@ ated for access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive benefits after the asylum application law more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ ale , as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ici@@ le persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ o@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span shortened to 15 months .
but also this gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually introduce the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion ratio .
it is also important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include obligations .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this includes readiness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to expose such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination office and an universal equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slowly learning how the NS@@ U murder series systematically ignor@@ es the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany , must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees so far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law stipul@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors especially make the language barriers to be created .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more inferior to their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpretation boxes need to be taken over , it demands .
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical centers in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee camps , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ education .
with the partially other diseases of the disease German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the refugees may possibly even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and take ex@@ ams possibly again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst acc@@ esses the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to put every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; management cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to hold up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and agi@@ lity - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous Lach@@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with t@@ act and articul@@ ation .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
serp@@ ent people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
so the top priority : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals have lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas daily from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 hrs .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , went down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also prov@@ oked by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned about disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to expand 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses helping businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ successful , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league player in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an an@@ tedi@@ ous time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al will start its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need to have a little break @-@ up break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ far hopes to lead the association to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ se .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ ship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man to question the culture that men hin@@ dered to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms determined that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy fortune .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football boots in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y I explained , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My guidance for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger themselves has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but after that , they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion since it does not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back relaxed even though there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could last weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up in Johan Wil@@ and passing beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ements and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who at no less than five attempts alone in the first half was scrat@@ ched and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a goal at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game from them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner League winner , four times champion League winner , two times club champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already standing before the European Union in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for it works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 was running with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the red turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ne@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white stallion .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film director &apos;s rights ; Dam@@ on responded that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement posted a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured inclu@@ sions .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ wers who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operator assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over the prize of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to ascend within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the 7th Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finale run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit added a insurance run at the end of the ninth brief@@ ing , Wall reached a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hand @-@ h@@ anders , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two pati@@ os against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third thing the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since the 20th August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees are expected to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden provided on Tuesday evening .
they expected 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
alone over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen for the first admission of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective observation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup was passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down at our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is arranged in such a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could hold a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her specific figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee disaster in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who have no perspective of lead can also not stay in Germany .
this view had been strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from seeking ev@@ asion over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who average the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean is sw@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the moon is easily stag@@ ger@@ ed around the ring plane .
although this movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers are presenting their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade paper .
it was known for some time that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ ill water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers at that time closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain already at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; is estimated to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view on the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest the Six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kro@@ ate currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility of proving his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training again next week after his bra@@ ins .
the Austrian national player is supposed to climb into the running training already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
contrary to first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender lines are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them are B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the US parcel service U@@ PS re@@ stores up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
drivers are especially sought .
last year , U@@ PS raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services .
first blow @-@ storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side of the F@@ öhn blows , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the com@@ promis@@ ist valleys .
on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest @-@ current .
on the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side , on the night of the F@@ öhn blows through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with ar@@ cs from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent medi@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , moisture begins to dust at the alpine slope .
this is where rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , this after the last few days a huge amount of rain has already fallen .
on Thursday morning , the blow @-@ dryer ki@@ cks off the air , resulting in a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind re@@ fres@@ hes up to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures rise significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the square , symbo@@ lically it becomes apparent that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) spent a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city back then as a perfect sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions might have reinforced him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with sump@@ tuous images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he has fascinated several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar and thus translated into contemporary contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to gain a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out this , so that I might be able to bear with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s perception of image worlds is marked by advertising , and that &apos;s loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is sup@@ planted there .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them look , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but chosen for him , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn approaches
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured d@@ oom , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be approved in October , the first coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga provides a clear indication on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the increasing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , it &apos;s nothing to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to debate the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive course must be the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations put a clear sign when on the left side of the tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do football feder@@ ations , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their places have started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will jointly present 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
report : SAP CEO loos@@ es an eye on accident
head of Chief of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he almost died , was power@@ less , and then pulled out onto the street - he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was always in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can pass something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as reserve driver for the two common quot@@ as Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ tables at the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group play of the Europa League have finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its parent position on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of Roman citizen Roman br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement of fellow players R@@ eus that the final draft for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says middle field player Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the br@@ ink of the Frankfurt Motor Show from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase on digital radio .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey of the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent don &apos;t count on it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 per cent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , this could be 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current state of the title fight , Düsseldorf plans to take up only one single individual on the title battles of September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the coach trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste into Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo was also missing , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : in order to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot filed 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers Old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the designer &apos;s first , delicate fashion attempts .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught fashion for designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first show he won &apos;t be able to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ der@@ ies in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were produced in a large amount for customers , for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en j@@ ammer .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styles , is an increasing job potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private business and wholesale prices are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine li@@ cks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broader for the world
the economy must open to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new businesses and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a series of directives , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and businesses that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance since it grants the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a rule @-@ of @-@ law business environment and more open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lawyers &quot; right to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli attended the meeting , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to expect a significantly higher dose of nerve damage to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ ably .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , particularly in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts especially in cases of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on its homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted in March of paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish accounted for the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RA@@ S@@ FF .
