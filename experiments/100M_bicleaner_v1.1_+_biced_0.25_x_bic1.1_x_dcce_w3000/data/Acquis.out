the securing measures after this agreement are terminated in relation to core material when the community and the organization realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able for a nuclear activity that is under the viewpoint of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang .
the Community noti@@ fies the organization in accordance with the Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this Convention .
the safegu@@ ards for this Convention are terminated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility .
the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the backup measures will be based on the underlying material .
should the core material be used after this agreement , in case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the community agreed with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this agreement with regard to this material .
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives in the period of non @-@ use of the safety measures after this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community meet a provision that the safegu@@ ards intended in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards should not be applied .
in any case , the measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are re@@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organisation is held by the total quantity and composition of the material contained in the state or the states concerned , and on any passing on such material from this state or these states on the current account .
this explains their consent as soon as possible ; it extends only to matters such as time and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a knowledge of the military activity , nor does it refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs of each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons , who are subject to their sovereign powers , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se the costs as long as it has agreed in advance .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the supervis@@ ors of the organisation .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states .
any claim which the community or a state may claim against the organization or the organization towards the community or a state for damages , except for damages from a nuclear incident , arising from the implementation of the security measures after this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
if the Council fails to verify the relevant information submitted by the General Director that the organization has not been able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to security measures after this Convention , shall allow the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account what measures have been achieved by the assurance measures applied , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations take place on questions resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which shall not be settled in the negotiation process or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , on the request of a party of arbit@@ ral tribunal consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also ap@@ points two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed as arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who presi@@ des over .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organization may elect the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint those arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the Organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention .
II . if the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this State for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties over a change of the Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The General Director instruc@@ ts all Member States of the organization immediately of any change in the Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force .
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable to the implementation of the provisions of the Part I concerning preventive measures .
the objective of the safety measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the bi@@ fur@@ cation of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such a turn by the risk of premature discovery .
for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the target defined in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified for a specified period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the stated amounts .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structuring of material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following nature and , as far as necessary , see how they are more determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of not measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that displays the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone including the input and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Ret@@ ur@@ ns that make sure the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic en@@ rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or another , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other safety precau@@ tions mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nuclear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the core material , which would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards after this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of the core material freed due to this Article in the states is at no time more than
a ) a total of a kilogra@@ m of special fis@@ sile material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if a delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the security measures after this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re@@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organization supple@@ mental agreements , which are required in the extent necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organisation under this Convention , in detail , as to how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or amended without alter@@ ation of the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements shall come into force with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all the efforts so that these agreements may enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ action between the organisation , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , provides a aggreg@@ ated inventory of all the underlying material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry on this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Co @-@ operation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource allocation problems .
C ) The objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years of entry into force in form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC presented a table to be seen in which way it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction &quot; that consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special interaction account ; this account is governed by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separate and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective State to order of the organization as the administrator of the specialized transaction and to be deposited in the organization of the organisation in the concerned country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days of the entry into force of the agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the management at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines specified for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school j@@ acks in order to cover expenses for the loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the case of granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
( VII ) The extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are to be considered , approved and administr@@ ated for the purposes stated under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( bank ) or the organization that is bound within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally applicable to the loans granted by the organization ; thus , they are re@@ payable in ten years of free each year in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that reserves it .
each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is given in particular .
the revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organisation and that may be the recipient of a loan granted at the time of the loan granted .
cash withdraw@@ als from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the relevant Member State as soon as possible .
until full disclosure of all the special transaction loans , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation .
during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator holds the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator shall send the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC transfers to the E@@ EC as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts payable on the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward lead an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account from time to time , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date on the E@@ EC and the Organisation , the agreements and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States cri@@ pple the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the proper approval of this agreement with the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two letters in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter changing to the change of An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T en@@ acted the following :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; Shar@@ ed Company J@@ ET &quot; under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty .
for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since until practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has reached a higher priority due to the energy crisis -
this agreement shall enable any contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and thus achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. , the cost @-@ effective electricity production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster .
to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss Programme is taking over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation with the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is enlarged or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
every time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs mentioned in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of member states &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit lines with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the agreement paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments of the member states .
now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which application the BI@@ S would be prepared .

with the opening of the loans as well as their possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit entry fee .

conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S needs to obtain the necessary funds in the market itself , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to a corresponding margin raised .

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and H@@ amm@@ als
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ b weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure through appropriate procedures that the quantity actually executed does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional Off@@ er forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the committee mentioned below in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective cl@@ auses , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected by this agreement .

the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st clause mentioned under number 5 .
the total quantity referred to in number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ b weight .
the community takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meats are not under@@ min@@ ted due to the implementation of the regulation the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by issuing export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all the necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved .
in addition , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals reports the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may be en@@ code according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat
I honor to refer to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy are important and that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
after this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat will ensure access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement .
new Zealand ob@@ tains the assurance that the normal he@@ el of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure the proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the actual quantity of the annual quantity of the agreement did not exceed the set amount .
the prescribed quantities are carried out in the conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the Community market .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the clause mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective cl@@ auses , it comm@@ its itself to protect New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement .
in the event that the imports from New Zealand are exceeding the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a sc@@ ech rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .

the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in the clause 5 mentioned in clause 5 .
the total quantity referred to in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ b weight .
the community does everything in order to avoid market development which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meats are not under@@ mined due to the execution of the regulation .
in addition , both parties are undertaking everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without danger to market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products .
new Zealand comp@@ lies with the observ@@ ance of the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular by issuing export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all the necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export license , which is given by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena must not occur : a ) hem@@ atic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analysed on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum fer@@ til@@ ation in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of blood flow in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B agents , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are drawn up at the time .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tis which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow .
the ti@@ ter releases the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series with a micro@@ scopic level of ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin of the WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain unchanged for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the re@@ taining tests ; it is approved by the state regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the pre@@ conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black @-@ and @-@ white printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this liberation to the jurisdiction of the Community falls that has been established by the Treaty by which it has been established , which has the necessary powers to do so ;
from the time of its entry into force , this Ad@@ ditional Protocol is part of the Convention . from that point on , a state may not become the contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol .

in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use paper documents instead of the position paper .
if the integrated paper is used , the parties involved may agree with the approval of the relevant authorities for the provision of all the con@@ form@@ i@@ ties associated with the export and import duties , instead of the supple@@ mental sheets on the trading paper , in which the goods are described .
- to close each other agreement or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the form@@ alities for their entire goods traffic or for sections ;
- for shipments which include several types of goods , to facilitate the provision of the goods in the shipping method Lad@@ eli@@ sts instead of the supplements to use a single @-@ position paper ;
