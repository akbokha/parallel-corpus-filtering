<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC presented a table to be seen in which way it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special transaction" that consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special interaction account; this account is governed by the organization as a steward and used (in this capacity, the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separate and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the member state, which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective State to order of the organization as the administrator of the specialized transaction and to be deposited in the organization of the organisation in the concerned country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the application within 30 days of the entry into force of the agreement or to another between the EEC and the management at the appointed time;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school jacks in order to cover expenses for the loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">(VII) The extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>

<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organisation and that may be the recipient of a loan granted at the time of the loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Cash withdrawals from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the relevant Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full disclosure of all the special transaction loans, the administrator teaches the EEC concerning the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator holds the EWG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
