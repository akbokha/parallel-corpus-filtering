this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has reviewed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness in which the patient have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to take or the melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time , which are eliminated as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted .
this im@@ pairs the transmission of signals between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ surgery , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the changes in the patient &apos;s symptoms by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take absor@@ bs .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients presenting Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 m@@ g. were significantly more severe in symptoms than those receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks , and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , kel@@ isie ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes , out@@ weighed the risks associated with the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the acquisition of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 m@@ g. was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no higher suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ erte and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dropped .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) associated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of resor@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the can height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be attributed to a moderate rise in ari@@ bo@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ ous / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( ey@@ ec@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( op@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns produced in reproductive studies at the animal , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study spann@@ ing 52 weeks , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Parkinson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with semi @-@ surgery ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ lan@@ t@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ operated surgery .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term follow @-@ up period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
no medi@@ cally significant differences were found between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters occurred .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch of un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine dop@@ amine dop@@ amine receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine dop@@ amine , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a semi @-@ surgery @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who participated in the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and semi @-@ surgery 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Depression Gra@@ dient , showed significantly more improvement than in semi @-@ surgery .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ apse at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % of placebo .
in an oil @-@ t@@ apped , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed an efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ atic in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ atic .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior approach to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ apse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as non @-@ gender @-@ dependent effects in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic patients .
a presentation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varied liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equ@@ als 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study were found in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an oil @-@ t@@ apped , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections should be terminated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ fer@@ menting adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy tray tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( through prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ erte and malign@@ ant form ) .

clinical manifestations of m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dan was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) was used as a single indication intra@@ muscul@@ arly and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of resor@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the can height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg doses ) received intra@@ muscul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dan was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ecting solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term follow @-@ up period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
no medi@@ cally significant differences were found between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters occurred .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ o kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral dysfunction was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ecting solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvement of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to half operating i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to the ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al impair@@ ment compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a semi @-@ surgery @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who responded to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ surgery ( 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Depres@@ sions@@ Rate scale , showed a significantly greater improvement compared to semi @-@ operated surgery .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ apse which was at 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an oil @-@ t@@ apped , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior approach to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ apse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C was 90 % larger after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application did not reveal any safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ern@@ ally exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 mal ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety review , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 @-@ times the medium steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the medium steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane spoke to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it should also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted authorisation for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use with children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly exposed Kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been detected , cardiac events in the inde@@ xed patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of the treatment of sperm cont@@ our because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated in pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , chest pain , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness . very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the amal@@ gam@@ ation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is thought that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ corneal transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and is based on the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( re@@ cover@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two approved non@@ verbal studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ az@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of one grade for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during the treatment .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or crossover frequency of Pac@@ lit@@ axel .
a study involving advanced solid tumours enrolled the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ axel after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for the un@@ altered ure@@ a was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

after the complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the pier@@ cing bottle should be wa@@ ved slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be gently inver@@ ted again in order to achieve a complete reset before the application .
the exact dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the appropriate amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for the placing on the market before the market launch provides healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product , cool@@ ers for transport through the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections may also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver if they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
for administration as an injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with a study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a vein for at least eight weeks before they either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of stre@@ amed out under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most frequent side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
secre@@ tion as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to the healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned major operating procedures requiring large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be attended to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and as a result may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical progress and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose : 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and - consequ@@ ential complications may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical progress and disease condition is required by the doctor .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling the symptoms of an@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the vertical value of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the starting value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg of ≥ 1 g / kg ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation rate increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value is a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required , should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medication in the circul@@ atory system .
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients that are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; in patients with recently undergone cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA according to months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden action loss defined as a reduction in the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation value is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a drug is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ e@@ as if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in intake should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minim@@ ise the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients that need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ related an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ine should be based on a benefit / risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s participation , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients that are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may per@@ sist when treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven that they can improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy after receiving ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration from 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with cephal@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of cephal@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the cephal@@ os@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
from in @-@ vitro studies on tumour tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in terms of hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically determined epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ ded and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 m@@ am@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the controls .
in these studies , patients with an@@ a@@ emia treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ resolved , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ an events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa terms after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last dose .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animals experimental studies with approximately 20@@ x of the weekly dose recommended in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ al body weight , to a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fo@@ etus mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the drug co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system introduced in version 3.0 and introduced in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation is established and functional before the drug is taken into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the traffic .
the owner of the authorization for the placing on the market obli@@ ges to undertake the studies and additional measures referred to in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance as described in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as the update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • while receiving new information , the impact on current safety specifications , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures may have • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction related ) mil@@ estones • following the request by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment , if you suffer from an unstable Ang@@ ina P@@ ec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time appearing or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of bleeding in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial sep@@ sis ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it may result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms during further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with se@@ amed before the start of the treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will break your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , secre@@ tion must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of hei@@ gh@@ tened or rising potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion marks by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood vessels with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood sugar levels ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your chosen dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , remember that se@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment starts .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / used other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or for HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and make sure your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of intervention and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your physician considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out yourself among the skin .
heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with the secre@@ tion - to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events .
the treatment with se@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood sample after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output level is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones fragile ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 ) before the first in@@ fusion ( 50 000 to 125 000 ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a has been used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down the bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta appear in the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to authori@@ ze A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union .

o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • A contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When focusing on medical or nursing care
o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
for patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get .
after treating the disease Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta In@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data for safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ation is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ ting of the effect of fo@@ lic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ation may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates to a dental screening with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side @-@ effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased by patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with kidney function disorders that referred to as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years between the placebo and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cholesterol within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal level of swelling ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of fo@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion location such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the ortho@@ don@@ ti@@ sts has been treated , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zinc cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area at a patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ation , a compensation can be achieved by offering or@@ ally calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ine frac@@ tures decreased significantly over a period of three years , as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent impact over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the skull number by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic crest after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture in comparison to placebo .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times .
compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % of the placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the cervical verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at the patho@@ gen &apos;s patho@@ gen A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , predominantly mild to moderate patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.3 % age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain influence after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients classified as &quot; Respon@@ der &quot; at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma gas rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination interval t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
the early stages ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ aci@@ dic concentrations by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients examined ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function breakdown down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require the dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ x of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats was administered ; in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at intraven@@ ous injection .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats were observed in rats starting from 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period according to preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation acts and works before and while the product is marketed .
Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The holder of the authorization for the placing of the market obli@@ ges the studies and additional activities to the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance that are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorization application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current safety , drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is assembled un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are using / used other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
since A@@ cla@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ ting of the effect of fo@@ lic acid to bone reconstruction , a transi@@ ent , sometimes symptom@@ atic @-@ running , hypo@@ kal@@ ation may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over and over which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and moreover one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking .
however , studies on the attitudes of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia found during studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is required when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or iso@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data for efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disease or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any recognizable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other approaching persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were completed by trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has reviewed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily in the highest toler@@ able dose alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl @-@ resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced by the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl alcohol or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
for more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl alcohol , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos introduced a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ de showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a licence for placing Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compensated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ to@@ il discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters are preceded by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the medium ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after its launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , onset or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is not clear whether there is a direct correlation between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frames per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare cases : unknown ( from this data cannot be estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the index of refra@@ ction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents above the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ de .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of adverse events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with peer @-@ to @-@ peer groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin doses in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant rise in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while reduced values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the sodium tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come trial , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the top concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively labeled pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination range of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to humans 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hic occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the creation decreases and increases insulin resistance of the mother animal , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) induced increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ines led to increased frequency of col@@ on@@ tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frames per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the sodium tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on tr@@ yp@@ hi@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was lacking the target of their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels indicating that blood sugar levels have been reduced to similar levels to human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package content ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane compared to the risks involved in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for placing Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , when a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly for example by intensified insulin therapy may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi @-@ phase , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account any possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape gather@@ ings , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an assigned help person or glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for placing Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin has to be re@@ plen@@ ished , then the amount of insulin @-@ active insulin .

aden@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit signs of de@@ position , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ ster@@ oids ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ anium deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic continue to take other medicines for the prevention of toxic@@ ity at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ic dos@@ ages ( 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ c@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 m@@ g. daily for the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardiac complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ c@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available g@@ out and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ n@@ age bar is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ generating drugs , acute arthritis may occur during the treatment process , because by lowering the serum level of the serum , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine zinc did not carry any interaction studies at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ one mirror ( a hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous addition of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study involving test persons 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous intake of a ta@@ xim@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .

experimental studies do not have direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious in controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous operations until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ ic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events occurring in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the reported events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the data .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

the mechanism of action of ur@@ ic acid in humans is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reaction chain hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ im selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ c@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point of each study was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
Plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum iron content at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the daily dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ments &lt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ ar@@ ised for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 vs Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 vs 80 mg
the reduction of serum resin levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol grade &lt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. , h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum levels in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ c acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which in 54 % of patients resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased propor@@ tionally by F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low levels of vitamin D .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lay down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company introduced data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that demonstrate that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , auf@@ actu@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour up@@ lift .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be applied in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not cr@@ ush the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract but p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to relieve the drug in the occurrence of symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn medicine and getting medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms pointed to an imp@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
although there was no increased risk in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which give hints whether stopping a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ itative for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally scheduled on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women only and is therefore not used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports were cancer patients , but also o@@ steopor@@ osis was reported .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums received up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum @-@ phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups of similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued , as well as the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % vs Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an IV reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a noc@@ turn@@ al fast and two hours before receiving a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability correspon@@ dingly increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily after intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 71 ml / min and systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not thought that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the addition of radio@@ actively tagged vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the average elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the mani@@ folds after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results of previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , where the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by investigating how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the intake dose or the dose of the simultaneously taken medication must be adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in isolated cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to the level of the valley , comparable to both ni@@ th@@ - and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low clearance , an adjustment of the an@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow any oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be converted a gra@@ ft receptor of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the or@@ al initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily .
other gra@@ ft receptor Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , p@@ ank@@ an and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day was used for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood @-@ age levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels , a calculation of cre@@ atine content and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror Contro@@ ls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level mirror during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after adjusting Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age Adju@@ st@@ ment , Chan@@ ges of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or by using substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the medi@@ al level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts and cardiac and heart transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 for the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ an@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart gra@@ ft recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formula Adv@@ agra@@ f .
the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) is due to possible interactions that can lead to a de@@ composition of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscles in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Progra@@ f , an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy could be observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes by appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
as Adv@@ agra@@ ph Hart@@ capsules contain , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the risk of endo@@ cr@@ ine exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs often cannot be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

cases of BK virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymph@@ oma cells ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ ed Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases resulted in the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ - syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower .
a multi@@ center trial with oral Progra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation which were random@@ ized to receive a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initiation dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of talent from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral program as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly performed via the g@@ all .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f for stable patients who were switched to Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level mirror during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ an@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced which enables it to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years , the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings as well as for surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
supplements may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence to transport lawyers across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the event of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma gas ( in % of standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment run , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to Factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ life times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II @-@ Plasma@@ Activities is not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be directed to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , with the risk inherent within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low ti@@ tr@@ ation ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience over the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
AD@@ R@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of the patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II was observed after surgery ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma Valley and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ ic@@ to@@ i@@ dia reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .

based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive one , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder will apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited formally announced the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Woman &apos;s Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues which connect , surrounds and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly with Li @-@ Woman &apos;s Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li @-@ Woman &apos;s Cancer in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection is beneficial to the patient in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tumours .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company does not inform CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredients release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other is slowly released over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , through an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be stopped as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were left alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , anti @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from an angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , or cereb@@ ral strokes ( stroke caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for placing an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow whole ( i.e. without breaking up , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms do not end .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , because the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy when necessary with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks following such therapy .
this can be attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lip@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ c@@ tiva ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , n@@ zu@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headache or a strengthening of headache ) must be reli@@ eved .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , irrespective of whether or not the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vi@@ vo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the discomfort of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not decrease the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult micro @-@ secre@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , prev@@ ent@@ ative pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dro@@ ught , pup@@ il @-@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard gau@@ ges of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause more symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher based on the total score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ uring gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure according to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional drug safety studies , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 , the drug co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine .
when used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to he@@ ade@@ dness or atten@@ u@@ ates the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects which are not stated in this information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely were reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , ga@@ stri@@ c discomfort , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleeping disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for taking ( soluble pill ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution for taking .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by investigating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the no@@ d@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the acceptance of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to authori@@ ze A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness and can be terminated after the onset of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during their recovery .
in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , compared to patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects , reported more frequently than placebo , were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical doses ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which a dose of 45 mg per day ( nine times the clinical dosage ) was administered more than ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard gau@@ ges of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n show no particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data to support treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing and experiencing a higher substance exposure ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are limited to metabol@@ ise is identical to that of children who normally metabol@@ ise .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ type absorption , or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study for adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied for more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was not detected by increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ dose daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not cause any impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it did not result in an increase in sleep@@ iness due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the induced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the dis@@ semination of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that limit their metabolism .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ X and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses with those of adults receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown plastic bottles with a child safe polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets every day , compared to patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study involving up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical doses ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where a dose of 45 mg per day ( nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied for more than ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not turn significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for the insertion of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was equal to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that are limited to metabol@@ ise is identical to that of children who normally metabol@@ ise .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
infants between 6 and 23 months were the most commonly reported side effects , reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects was observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 .
the recommended doses were similar to the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was not detected by increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on duration of symptoms .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of influenza H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov was to be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus arises , which can easily spread from person to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as a &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which detects the human body as alien ) , was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
ag@@ ne@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is al@@ ase after body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gener@@ ase , which was strengthened with low dose @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few people responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medication A@@ gener@@ ase reinforced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was as effective after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it was found under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
ag@@ ne@@ ase should also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are broken down just like ag@@ ne@@ ase and are in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ er@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ ne@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years were out@@ weighed against the risks .
ag@@ ne@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of ag@@ ne@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to authori@@ ze the placing of ag@@ ro@@ gases in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking is 14 % lower than Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the added addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ ne@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ ne@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with slight or moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver impair@@ ment it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
ag@@ ne@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r during the use of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ag@@ ne@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis also show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ap@@ e@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for ob@@ session symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
ag@@ ne@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other disorders requiring medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r resulting in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose @-@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can be brought low by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johannis@@ k@@ raut , the det@@ on@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , examine the virus strain and drain the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confirming the efficacy and discomfort of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given ; however , close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ ne@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adaptation is required in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
should this medicine be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous addition of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin lead to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ather@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with ag@@ ne@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase since it can come to resor@@ ption dysfunction .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
con@@ current consumption with ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ate can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , fluor@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma gas are expected at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma levels increase these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these pharmaceuticals with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic levels is recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with an oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while careful treatment of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate possible increase in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma gas from 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for ob@@ session symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adapted if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
for simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r to the parent animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the ag@@ ne@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early on and rarely led to treatment termination .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used simultaneously for HIV treatment or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of ag@@ ne@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in people with HIV , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals treated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in combination with ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed under Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of ag@@ ne@@ ase twice daily along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received ag@@ ne@@ ase along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein levels as a result of formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in case of acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ pa@@ yed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral properties previously untreated ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study involving PI pre @-@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to time @-@ adjusted A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ subsidiary threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ baked A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the previously untreated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the overall dosage in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be small .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel testing of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by means of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ag@@ ne@@ ase after the treatment has ended .
studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the added addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ ne@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function disorders , in patients with severe liver impair@@ ment it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug dependent factors such as longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r resulting in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given ; however , close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
if these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster the ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .

for simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.00@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in case of acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the overall dosage in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation paths in juven@@ ile are not yet fully mature so that Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . )

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking is 14 % lower than Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to take it ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ne@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for insertion and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of metabolism of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ag@@ ne@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
ag@@ ne@@ ase should be stopped permanently , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as older age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r resulting in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ current consumption with ag@@ ne@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
based on the data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 55 body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used simultaneously for HIV treatment or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ pa@@ yed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a promising 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine has been prescribed to you personally .
it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of am@@ ag@@ ase .
the use of ag@@ ne@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment plan .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the medicine mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the information to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before beginning treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening effects in children aged 4 to 12 or in general in patients under 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control the inclin@@ ation of the blood . − When patients receive an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .
if you have certain medicines that may lead to serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may possibly perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not be able to breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to prevent HIV transmission .
no studies have been carried out on the influence of ag@@ ne@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to serve machines .
please do not take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from an intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced .
dose of ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that the intake of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
if you use 85 Dam@@ it A@@ gener@@ ase , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed .
if you have taken a larger amount of ag@@ ne@@ ase than you should have taken when you have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ est@@ ase , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you miss taking A@@ gener@@ ase after you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking as before .
in the treatment of HIV infection , it is not always possible to tell if any side effects are caused by ag@@ glut@@ ination , other medicines that are taken simultaneously , or caused by the HIV infection itself .

dose of ag@@ ne@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in order for e@@ gener@@ ase to benefit as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed .
if you have taken larger amounts of ag@@ ne@@ ase than you should have taken when you have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ est@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sacri@@ ficial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for inclusion was not demonstrated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the application of lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( usually used to increase the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in , no dosage recommendations can be given .
( rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution for insertion ) , or additionally Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase should not be taken ) .
your doctor will probably observe side effects associated with the propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in , especially if you have a kidney or liver disease .

( rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution for insertion ) or additional propylene gly@@ col intake should not be taken during the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see As@@ gener@@ ase should not be taken ) .
important information about certain other components of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to ing@@ ress The solution for taking contains propylene gly@@ col which can lead to side effects in high doses .
Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart disease and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase should not be taken , special caution is required when taking A@@ gener@@ ase ) .
if you miss taking A@@ gener@@ ase after you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking as before .
headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness , vom@@ iting , blo@@ ating rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine .
this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , fat accumulation on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat fl@@ ushing in the neck ( &quot; stit@@ ching &quot; ) .
the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum sweet@@ ness , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For a maximum of 16 weeks Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week . • For patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be performed five times a week for six weeks .
the cream must be applied thin to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time , so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) in all trials . Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic nucle@@ i .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full recovery rate in all four primary studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( sor@@ eness or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic or hyper@@ trop@@ hic nucle@@ i ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or accept@@ ability of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine can continue for a long time until all visible bow@@ war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ dicals , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period was completely healed after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and cre@@ sted in the clean@@ sed skin area , until the cream is fully pulled in .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies in which no daily pre @-@ h@@ eter@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision were observed .
when applying i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the end of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments for the treatment of external fe@@ e@@ ders in the genital and peri@@ anal area , no clinical experience has so far been available .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of aff@@ er@@ ent reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days may be made .
after regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the treatment can be judged approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tumours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic nucle@@ i on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip .
very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic nucle@@ i in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arm and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
if the local skin reactions inflic@@ t severe discomfort on the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
the data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were achieved either once or after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given for use during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of cow@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and than likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported side @-@ effects .
the most frequent , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction at the site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this review of clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine often results in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ tr@@ ation / leaves / fla@@ king ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
this review of clinical signs presented according to test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe formation and cal@@ orie ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
accidental intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy is significantly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ war@@ ts in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the overall 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the patients healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing was achieved in 23 % of male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ hand use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumor was hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally defined bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face .
the five @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical ab@@ stain@@ ing after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of extern@@ al@@ cell carcin@@ oma , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , which points to an extended retention of the medication in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low after topical application to MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat lead doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ charging devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to admini@@ stering to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion station .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be disclosed each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. a licence to authori@@ ze Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ varies , Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored closely , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients will form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience is present in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously performed .
60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of moderate or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not have direct or indirect effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma that were observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Eff@@ ects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe sl@@ ur@@ ry form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patient at the age of 5 underwent a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version usually within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature termination from the study ) , no antibodies were detected by radio@@ immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ ic@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust decrease in the G@@ AG level in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substance and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely with man@@ nose 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma was studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 minute scale .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the sal@@ vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( as expected , normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe compression and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed in older patients .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute scale test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ as is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available each year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
based on conventional drug safety studies , toxic@@ ity with a unique dose , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ able dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not detect any specific dangers for humans .

this register will require long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase inhibit@@ ors certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma or if you have noticed a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking drugs containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should intake Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from spl@@ itting .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta demonstrated longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to authori@@ ze A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flas@@ k bottle must be dissolved with a 4.3 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and during the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake should be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under the rap@@ ture of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o nen a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients with age 65 of age or over 65 years of age .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold increase of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not examined specifically in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ sis has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the absolute neutral number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed if pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients undergoing treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long shelf life for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive ability is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding the sperm cont@@ our .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to a reduced break @-@ in elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore advisable when high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
as no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long shelf life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless necessarily - demanding and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to take advice regarding the sperm cont@@ our .
it is not known whether compo@@ unding is exceeded in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance , occasionally reported .
from clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal ble@@ ed@@ ings , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
clinical trials sometimes reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis was reported in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting the need for fol@@ lic@@ - and fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ pos@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural epitheli@@ um showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was demonstrated in the application of the Lun@@ ar cancer tumor in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms of arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.@@ 0 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a controlled random@@ ized controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adapted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

solve the content of the 500 mg diar@@ rhe@@ a bottles with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies , patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stool , bow@@ el pull , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients are absorbed in the digestive tract ) or on chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing orders from Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ori , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic treatment with chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ mature ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a sin@@ king of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a one @-@ time dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials involving or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick re@@ formation of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ sive properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect plays in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ isch and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it is derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average total cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60@@ mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral dose of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general therapeutic doses could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minim@@ ally system@@ ically resor@@ bed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ on@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied before and while the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects which are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional symptoms : • Start some days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people who encounter these accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C . • Do not store over 25 ° C. The container tightly closed to protect contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

overweight has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • Heart disease • Cer@@ tain cancer • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
follow the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , take a look at the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule of action , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat supply is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat supply , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually reduce weight .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moderate physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you walk daily only little or no , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal each day , i.e. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal containing information on the calories and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acid and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the standard trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ is was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate release for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ is is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon massage , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or sign of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agonists , caution is advised at the simultaneous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to leng@@ then such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics investigated against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Hal@@ f@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) have no significant impact on the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron clearing .
experiences concerning the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 mc@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life hours 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine plus 250 or 750 mc@@ g. of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to assess the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron performed overall texture ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an IV dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , total body activity was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver function disorders , the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered to be sufficiently exposed to the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of the marketing authorization for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon introduced data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar to the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the extent to which the drug develops an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ peti@@ go ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go does not have an effect on these types of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and therefore inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most frequent side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical use on sk@@ im@@ less skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200 m@@ g. k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding should continue or termin@@ ate or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go had used was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the meeting place that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ uri@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ory of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ ome inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partly block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms would seem question@@ able , a consultation by experts should be aimed at .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be taken into consideration .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of man after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ y skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of abra@@ sive skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were noted .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
therefore , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan exists from two doses .
if a ref@@ res@@ sive dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vaccine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same illnesses , but Twin@@ et adults and tw@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix left between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six months and a 12 month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 The European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardis@@ ation plan for the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the time of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a vaccine is vacc@@ inated both for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ ological persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a ref@@ res@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection moul@@ ds , appropriate medical treatment and monitoring options should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vacc@@ ination scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines can be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously because in these cases intra@@ muscular administration may lead to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ er@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ les vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the former thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ing on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.1 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects having received the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects that had been vacc@@ inated using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ing was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units forming in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the serum levels ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation of the vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were at the time of prim@@ acy between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the launch of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ac , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza virus ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ant and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ sion .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorised laboratory for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by means of viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in water contaminated by waste .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not be fully protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ination doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the vaccine time ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be im@@ par@@ ted .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ chy r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has already had an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination using Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take further medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / has or has planned this in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be administered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Ad@@ ded di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
further side effects , which were very rare days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 inj@@ ected cans ) are :

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market , CH@@ MP believes that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ium is - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) respectively a nas@@ al secre@@ tion ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ otherapy could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ y in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
Am@@ mon@@ y was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rar@@ eness of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine was available .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing problems as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each pill AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as for clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occur through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of the ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an@@ es@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be accepted to produce phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate bi@@ ased between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen for each gram consumed .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues during the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen precip@@ itation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the or@@ ni@@ thine o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
following the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , nit@@ ric but@@ y@@ rate had no pla@@ ster@@ ous effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets yet , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al secre@@ tion .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ tles were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) before the birth , lesi@@ ons in the brain cells of the brain cor@@ tex came to lesi@@ ons .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an@@ es@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fluid .
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram consumed between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible during treatment , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of the neurological condition may occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium lau@@ ric but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory investigations are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium nit@@ ric but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , leaving the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory impair@@ ment and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14@@ 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with any dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the arter@@ ies to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to authori@@ ze the placing of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency interventions or early intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a second row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cle@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the doses are administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT once again testing the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ ant Bol@@ us without dose adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ro@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
although most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in the case of PCI patients , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding may occur throughout the treatment .
in patients who are war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can be achieved again prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
the experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant Group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently on adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dro@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reducing the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding centre , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant Group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently on adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed in terms of signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as the ani@@ on base region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether the thro@@ mb@@ ine is present in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 arms arms .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin Rep@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration of action than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged 4 to 17 .
in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % compared to 0.@@ 30 % compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or administered sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal cavity .
due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any changes in the effect of the activity , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the need for insulin .
3 insufficient dosing or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of one patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment diagram is changed .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ aliz@@ yl and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effects of symp@@ athetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not interfere with breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral treatment .
in the following , the un@@ desirable drug interactions known from clinical trials are sorted according to system organ@@ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin levels occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than normal insulin analog .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin delivery in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ately increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
it was evident from the data that a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal than with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was applied 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin Rep@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and in comparison with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin delivery in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
