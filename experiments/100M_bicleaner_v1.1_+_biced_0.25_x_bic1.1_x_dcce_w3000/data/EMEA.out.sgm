<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has reviewed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental illness in which the patient have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to take or the melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time, which are eliminated as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the transmission of signals between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter acts to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, suffering from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-surgery, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder suffering from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the changes in the patient's symptoms by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take absorbs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients presenting Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg. were significantly more severe in symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks, and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), kelisie (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes, outweighed the risks associated with the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the acquisition of Abilify in the European Union to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg. was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no higher suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelererte and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dropped.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in cases associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) associated with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesired cerebrovascular events with aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagia, polyphagia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary action of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the can height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed to a moderate rise in ariboprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphous / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (eyecin), 2C19 (opextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns produced in reproductive studies at the animal, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasional (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study spanning 52 weeks, patients treated with aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's, Dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with semi-surgery (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with oplantine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-operated surgery.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term follow-up period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">No medically significant differences were found between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters occurred.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch of unintended or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosage with Aripiprazl; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine dopamine dopamine receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine dopamine, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the gift of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-surgery-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients who participated in the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and semi-surgery 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Gradient, showed significantly more improvement than in semi-surgery.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oil-tapped, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which comprised 314 patients and in which primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% occurred in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazl showed an efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or semi-operatic in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or semi-operatic.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed a superior approach to the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and Hydroxylic acid of Aripiprazole, N-Dealkyulation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as non-gender-dependent effects in pharmacokinetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A presentation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equals 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study were found in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposures of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an advanced oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the medication to Abilify tablets, Abilify tray tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injections in patients with agility and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injections solution, patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">The safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (through prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelererte and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mn are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating, and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyphagia, polyphagia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedan was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) was used as a single indication intramuscularly and who simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the can height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term follow-up period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">No medically significant differences were found between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters occurred.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphospho kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioral dysfunction was the Aripiprazole injecting solution with statistically significant significant improvement of agility / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to half operating idol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to the agility and behavioural impairment compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a semi-surgery-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients who responded to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and semi-surgery (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg DepressionsRate scale, showed a significantly greater improvement compared to semi-operated surgery.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse which was at 34% in the aripiprazole (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an oil-tapped, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed a superior approach to the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC was 90% larger after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injections was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- or 5 times above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on the reproductive toxicity after intravenous application did not reveal any safety-related concerns after maternally exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 mal (rabbits) above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety review, toxicity with repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10-times the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared to the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane spoke to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">Patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer, in terms of these indicators, showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted authorisation for the placing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensoric neuropathy degree 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>

<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients following the gift of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of the treatment of sperm contour because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, elevated phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, chest pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness. very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal relationship with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active ingredient that promotes the amalgamation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymer.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel with the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is thought that this improved transendocorneal transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and is based on the albuminous protein SPARC (recoverted protein acidic rich in cysteine) in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two approved nonverbal studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastazation and 19% due to metastazation and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of one grade for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient exposition (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous dose of Abraxane in people with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or crossover frequency of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">A study involving advanced solid tumours enrolled the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane dose (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for the unaltered urea was 4% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years, because only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which blood transfusion complications may occur if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections may also be performed by the patient or his caregiver if they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietal deficiency, or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">For administration as an injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared with a study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo into a vein for at least eight weeks before they either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of streamed out under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were switched to Abseamed were maintained to the same extent as those who received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most frequent side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Secretion as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages to the healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG for placing seamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned major operating procedures requiring large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be attended to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and as a result may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical progress and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed in a patient via or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose: 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and - consequential complications may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical progress and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for controlling the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the recticulation of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the vertical value of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl over the starting value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg of ≥ 1 g / kg (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the recticulation count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the recticulation rate increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the starting value is a response to epoetin-alfa treatment improbable and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required, should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the tube of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medication in the circulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoetin in a erythroblastomia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients that are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or cerebrovascular diseases; in patients with recently undergone cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rarely reported about the appearance of an anti-body mediated PRCA according to months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden action loss defined as a reduction in the haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the recticulation value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the recticulation value is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason of a drug is found, the anti-erythropoetin-antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epoeas if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin intake should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimise the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epoetin alfa, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients that need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapyrelated anaemia - Dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoieine should be based on a benefit / risk assessment involving the patient's participation, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients that are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated before the beginning of epoetin-alfa treatment.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may persist when treated with epoetin alfa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been proven that they can improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia, or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy after receiving haemoglobin target concentration from 12 to 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with cephalporin, the blood levels of cephalporin should be controlled and the cephalosporin dose should be adapted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">From in-vitro studies on tumour tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in terms of hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral infarction), arterial thromboses, pulmonary thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from erythropoetin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoieines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically determined epoetin alfa is glycoded and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrate content is identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of native patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">With the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells, epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropogenesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the controls.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with anaemia treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed an unresolved, statistically significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000) before the first infusion (50 000 to 125 000) or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means of inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">To treat the disease Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures was investigated for a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two trials in a total of 357 patients and compared to risedronate (a different bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down the bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to patients under Aclasta (with or without osteoporosis treatment), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta appear in the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zinc citric acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides clarification material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to authorize Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages: • A contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When focusing on medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">For patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of Paget's disease, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treating the disease Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta Infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data for safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalation is to be treated with Aclasta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid inserting of the effect of folic acid to bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalation may develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be considered before applying bisphosphonates to a dental screening with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental interventions, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe side-effects reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased by patients receiving Aclasta (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) were the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledroneic was associated with kidney function disorders that referred to as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine clearing (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the placebo and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum cholesterol within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal level of swelling (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures following a recent fracture fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of folic acid in a large clinical trial was reported about local reactions to the infusion location such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the orthodontists has been treated, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw area), which have been treated with bisphosphonates, including zinc citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study involving 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the jaw area at a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalation, a compensation can be achieved by offering orally calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years for postmenopausal women (7.736 women aged 65 to 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric cycline fractures decreased significantly over a period of three years, as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent impact over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the skull number by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvic crest after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were measured in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% compared to the baseline and was kept at 28% below the starting value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the starting value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the starting value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not measured routinely but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effects on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in the HORIZON RFT study increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% of the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the cervical vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at the pathogen's pathogen Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, predominantly mild to moderate pathogen Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6x to 3.3% age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronc acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain influence after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients classified as "Responder" at the end of the six-month trial could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronc acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma gas rapidly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination interval t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Zoledronacidic concentrations by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) correlated with the creatinin-clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients examined (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function breakdown down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require the dose adaptation of the zoledronc acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (creatinin- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6x of recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledroneic acid in rats was administered; in dogs a 15-minute infusion was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred with other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysical of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats were observed in rats starting from 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage period according to preparation and conditions before the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens produced from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is assembled unordered, which makes bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are using / used other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has reviewed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) who cannot be adjusted satisfactorily in the highest tolerable dose alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl-resin or insulin, the present dose of the sulphonyl resins or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced by the dose of the sulphonyl alcohol or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl alcohol, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos introduced a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl harnde showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a licence for placing Actos across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white until whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular vascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, tortoil discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters are preceded by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction in the medium haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulphonyl-resin and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After its launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thiazoldindian, including pioglitazone, onset or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct correlation between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of vision; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 frames per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; rare cases: unknown (from this data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and the index of refraction of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT-ascents above the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphonyl harnde.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macular vascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of adverse events in randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients in groups treated with Pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients treated with peer-to-peer groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ) (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclaxis).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction of insulin doses in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slight, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant rise in LDL cholesterol was observed under pioglitazone, while reduced values were observed under metformin and Gliclaxis.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sodium triglycerides but also improved post-prandial increased triglyceride levels, both on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular vascular disease were randomised in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the top concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in the plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been proven that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively labeled pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the decay (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination range of immutable pioglitazone amounts to humans 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophic occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the creation decreases and increases insulin resistance of the mother animal, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years) induced increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolines led to increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 frames per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with either pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sodium triglycerides but also improved post-prandial increased triglyceride levels, both on tryphizerid absorption and hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking the target of their primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased proportionally by Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lay down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the Company introduced data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower (11%) compared to those who received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that demonstrate that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), aufactuated abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as sour uplift.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal striktures, were reported in patients with Alendronat (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and patients should be advised to relieve the drug in the occurrence of symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or new or worsening heartburn medicine and getting medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms pointed to an impophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Although there was no increased risk in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate, stomach and duodenalulcera, among them some serious and complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1427">Other graft receptor Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankan and colorectal transplanted patients, a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day was used for transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood-age levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels, a calculation of creatine content and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the conversion from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases, with the aid of thoroughbred Tacrolimus Talmirror Controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of the tacrolimus level mirror during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after adjusting Prograf to Advagraph, Dosage Adjustment, Changes of immunosuppressive therapy or by using substances which could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraph is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose can take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the medial level of tacrolimus in the whole blood is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml in the first time after liver transplants and cardiac and heart transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart graft recipients and graft recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the retarded formula Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">The use of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraph (see Section 4.5) is due to possible interactions that can lead to a decomposition of the tacrolimuscles in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, an aqueous or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy could be observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligner skin changes by appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose for maintaining consistent concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the risk of endocrine exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially decrease the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signalling pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies discussed the observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung Transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multicenter trial with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis of obliteral syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after transplantation (2,86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosed Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases resulted in the emergence of a bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients treated by tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis of obliter- syndrome in the patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter trial with oral Prograf was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplantation which were randomized to receive a randomised tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initiation dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of talent from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly performed via the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf for stable patients who were switched to Advagraph (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under 6 years, the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleedings as well as for surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Supplements may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a licence to transport lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the event of the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma gas (in% of standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment run, adequate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to Factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII-PlasmaActivities is not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be directed to the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the prooagulatory activity of Factor VIII-oriented IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, with the risk inherent within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low titration) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there is no experience over the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs used in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which had a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of the patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease in the blood coagulation factor VIII was observed after surgery (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time, and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the Plasma Valley and the Clearance Rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were reported on the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the scope of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive one, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates submission of PSURs every 6 months, that the authorisation holder will apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited formally announced the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Woman's Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues which connect, surrounds and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the defective p53 gene in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The p53 protein is not working properly with Li-Woman's Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li-Woman's Cancer in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin injection is beneficial to the patient in Li-Fraumeni-tumours.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company does not inform CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified ingredients release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other is slowly released over a couple of hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, through an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be stopped as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hypocrisy symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms of 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who were left alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth drying, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, anti-adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from an angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism, or cerebral strokes (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for placing an aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow whole (i.e. without breaking up, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms do not end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, because the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy when necessary with desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks following such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This can be attributed to alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, lipid, cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deonctiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, nzuolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a strengthening of headache) must be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological testing, since antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed in clinical trials with desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, irrespective of whether or not the loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug does not inhibit and neither is a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The discomfort of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not decrease the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstric characteristics of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness, which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult micro-secretion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, preventative pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drought, pupil-rigid and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard gauges of flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher based on the total score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Lloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the alluring gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure according to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional drug safety studies, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007, the drug covigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of aerinaze: • hypertension • heart chase, heart palpitations • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When used in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to headedness or attenuates the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot the intake of aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects which are not stated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rarely were reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleeping disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver values has also been very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- Lyphilisat for taking (soluble pill), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml-solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the nodles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the acceptance of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to authorize Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous illness and can be terminated after the onset of the symptoms and resumed during their recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient may be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius, compared to patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects, reported more frequently than placebo, were tiredness (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-stage clinical doses).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which a dose of 45 mg per day (nine times the clinical dosage) was administered more than ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard gauges of flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of etiology, is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine is a causative factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with discoatadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patient demographics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant accumulation once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug does not inhibit and neither is a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with chloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Lloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken regardless of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data to support treatment of infectious rhinitis with aperius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are metabolizing and experiencing a higher substance exposure (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are limited to metabolise is identical to that of children who normally metabolise.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not take this medicine with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-type absorption, or a saccharase insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius syrup group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study for adults and adolescents, with up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-stage clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy received a daily desloratadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar to adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dosage) was applied for more than ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was not detected by increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single-dose daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not cause any impairment of psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults it did not result in an increase in sleepiness due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively diminish the induced by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this restrictive phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Kaukasiers (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that limit their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The loading (AUC) was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced to the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for approval of Aflunov for the prevention of influenza H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov was to be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus arises, which can easily spread from person to person, because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as a "body-alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as alien), was purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agnease should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose is alase after body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases the HIV-quantity in the blood when used in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure, but can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Agenerase, which was strengthened with low dose-dose kritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children previously treated with protease inhibitors, very few people responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults previously treated with protease inhibitors, the medication Agenerase reinforced with Ritonavir was as effective after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it was found under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Ampriavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agnease should also not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are broken down just like agnease and are in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase have the risk of lipoystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteonekersis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agnease in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors over four years were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agnease is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of agnease in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited to authorize the placing of agrogases in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase Capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of Ampriavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ampriavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ampriavir as a solution for taking is 14% lower than Ampriavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Ampriavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the added addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of agnease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ampriavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agnease in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of agnease capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with slight or moderate hepatic dysfunction, in patients with severe liver impairment it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agnease should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ampriavir during the use of Ampriavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be informed that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with agnease, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis also show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of apease with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients receiving this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Ampriavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ampriavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given to Ampriavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored for obsession symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agnease should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other disorders requiring medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemothrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ampriavir resulting in a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose-increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ampriavir can be brought low by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the detonavirus mirror and, if possible, examine the virus strain and drain the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Ampriavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increased for CMAx by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ampriavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ampriavir were twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, confirming the efficacy and discomfort of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ampriavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of Ampriavir in the plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra can not be given; however, close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin, but due to the fantasy component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and agnease are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adaptation is required in combination with Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should this medicine be used at the same time, caution is advisable since Delavirdine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of Ampriavir and Rifabutin lead to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with atherase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with azithromycin in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69times in comparison to the value observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4 can, if applied together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with agnease.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase since it can come to resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Ampriavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nife</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with agglutamate can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensation of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma gas are expected at the same time as Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels increase these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these pharmaceuticals with Ampriavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic levels is recommended up to stabilization of the mirrors, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with an oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while careful treatment of parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate possible increase in Midazolam plasma gas from 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ampriavir, patients should therefore be monitored for obsession symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, such as the Amprenavir dose is to be adapted if Ampriavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Ampriavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactose-related rats, but it is not known whether Ampriavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of breastfeeding, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Ampriavir to the parent animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the agnease treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early on and rarely led to treatment termination.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking Agenerase or any other medicine used simultaneously for HIV treatment or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of agnease twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in people with HIV, including a loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals treated with Ampriavir in combination with amivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernack) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTIs performed under Ampriavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapules nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Ampriavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In the case of PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of agnease twice daily along with low dose kritonavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received agnease along with low dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ampriavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein levels as a result of formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ampriavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp Concentration (IC50) of Ampriavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in case of acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ampriavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other ritonavir-payed treatment schemas with protease inhibitors, the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred by week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I47V, G48V, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with protease inhibitors performed over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Ampriavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I84V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data for estimating the activity of Ampriavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypical cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to Ampriavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Ampriavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral properties previously untreated (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tidenavir), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ampriavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance-mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study involving PI pre-treated adults following virological failure (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group with regard to time-adjusted AAUCMB (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-subsidiary threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbaked Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose kritonavir at the same time; the majority of the previously untreated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of "unfooster" agglutination.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ampriavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increased for CMAx by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ampriavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Ampriavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an unobstructed penetration of Ampriavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Ampriavir which represents the active part probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Ampriavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the overall dosage in the Steady state over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered cautiously if given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily Amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ampriavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and agnease capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a renal dysfunction on the elimination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir is likely to be small.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ampriavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro toxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests, mouse lymphom test, microkernel testing of rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, Ampriavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by means of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of agnease after the treatment has ended.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly lower (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the added addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of agnease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ampriavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function disorders, in patients with severe liver impairment it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>

<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra can not be given; however, close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2078">For simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.0035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindrone) resulted in a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Ampriavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2086">Conversely, Ampriavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance-mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the expected benefits of "unfoostered" agglutination should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of PI pretreated children.</seg>

<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pretreated BCCs, there are no clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimodine was not studied for the treatment of actinic nuclei on eyelids, inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data on the use of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic nuclei in anatomical places outside of the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the underarm and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy or go back after settling the therapy with imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions inflict severe discomfort on the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved either once or after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given for use during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of cowwarts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and than likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-cream related side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The patients reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study reported side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most frequent, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimodine-cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction at the site (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimodine-treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This review of clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three-week treatment with Imiquimodine often results in local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), extration / leaves / flaking (23%) and oedema (14%) (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This review of clinical signs presented according to test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine, it was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe formation and calorie (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Accidental intake of 200 mg imiquimodine, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could cause nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy is significantly superior to a complete healing of the cowwarts in Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the overall 119 patients treated with imiquimodine, the patients healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing was achieved in 23% of male patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five-hand use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumor was histologically confirmed single primary superficially defined basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The five-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical abstaining after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of externalcell carcinoma, actinic keratose and superficially basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed in the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2 hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study, which points to an extended retention of the medication in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimodine was low after topical application to MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at rat lead doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration in three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignizen (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the genitals (genitals) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to deformations, especially in the face - therefore, early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic nuclei are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in the face and scalp of patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with cowwarts in the genital region during intercourse, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have used other medicines or have recently applied even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during the treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether imiquimodine is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of cowwarts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the hands and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully wrapped.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks each week, apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A degrading number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue spot to develop more quickly or cause them to have a crash.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects which are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">This is usually lighter skin reactions, which end in about 2 weeks after settling the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, soreness, skin disease, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, flu or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, congestion, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, limb pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyma is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyms should take place in a hospital or a clinic with recharging devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administering to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyma may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylaktic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all the new information that may be disclosed each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyma will observe patients who receive aldurazyms in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a licence to authorize Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovaries, Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be monitored closely, and the infusion of Aldurazyma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients will form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience is present in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment has to be cautiously performed.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of moderate or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, serious infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been decreased, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not have direct or indirect effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exposed to laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyma that were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial edema (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe slurry form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patient at the age of 5 underwent a seroconversion usually within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature termination from the study), no antibodies were detected by radioimmunohistochemicitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust decrease in the GAG level in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substance and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely with mannose 6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyma was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walk in the 6 minute scale.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyms for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in the lung function and the salviability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (as expected, normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, movement area of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe compression and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in urine in week 22 during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed in older patients.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different aldurazyma dosing regimens were performed on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute scale test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemas is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available each year, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional drug safety studies, toxicity with a unique dose, toxicity in repeatable dose and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not detect any specific dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2336">Since no studies have been carried out, this drug may not be mixed with other medicines unless mixed with the ones listed below 6.6.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malign" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body).</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole treatment in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should intake Corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an antiemetic drug (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, discontinued or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta demonstrated longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to authorize Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flask bottle must be dissolved with a 4.3 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of necessary do- sis is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of phemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and during the day of the pemetremixed dose as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and intake should be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first pemetrexed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGPT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under the rapture of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the predicted treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose reductio nen a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients with age 65 of age or over 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold increase of the upper limit value and / or transaminases of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not examined specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to immunosuppression and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophysis has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the absolute neutral number of neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthonatologic toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed if pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent nonsteroidal antiphloistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients undergoing treatment with pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long shelf life for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion in front of the pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving Pemetremixed occasionally, if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Because the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised in front of the treatment regimen to obtain advice regarding the sperm contour.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to a reduced break-in elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advisable when high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As no data is available regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long shelf life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with pemetrexed for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, unless necessarily - demanding and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised to take advice regarding the sperm contour.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether compounding is exceeded in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies, patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains on anus, flatus (winch) with stool, bowel pull, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretion (feces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be applied to patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (with which not enough nutrients are absorbed in the digestive tract) or on cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalori, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18, because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Chronic treatment with cholestase • Premature (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dosage of antidiabetic needs to be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the oral contraception possible in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a sinking of the Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a one-time dose, Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials involving orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects found after the launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of reported cases of orlistat overdose, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick reformation of any systemic effects caused by the lipassive properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect plays in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastrisch and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it is derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation) was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average total cholesterol in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (starting value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral dose of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general therapeutic doses could only be detected sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimally systemically resorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Laconring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl leucine group) were identified, representing nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are the standard trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as an anti-emetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Alois was examined in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate release for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in severely emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients should be monitored closely with anamnestial obstipation or sign of a subacute ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised at the simultaneous dose of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in cases where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to lengthen such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics investigated against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Halfalin and Terbinafin) have no significant impact on the Palonosetron clearing.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences concerning the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with aloxi, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an alxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 750 mcg. of dolasetron (half-life hours 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">A total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine plus 250 or 750 mcg. of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study of strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was to assess the ECG effects of palonosetron administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportionally in the total dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron performed overall texture (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the iso enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an IV dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as immutable substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection, total body activity was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered to be sufficiently exposed to the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block Ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose met about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is determined for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the approval of the marketing authorization for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino-ferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon introduced data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar to the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than with the reference drug, and Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the extent to which the drug develops an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected infirmations (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provable or probably caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not have an effect on these types of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and therefore inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been provable or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical use on skimless skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg. ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breastfeeding should continue or terminate or the treatment with Altargo should be continued, is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo had used was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the meeting place that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Puriotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitory of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosome interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, partly block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms would seem questionable, a consultation by experts should be aimed at.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on skimmed skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of man after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of skimpy skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats microkernel test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of abrasive skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were noted.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan exists from two doses.</seg>

<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "" "" "Ambirix contains the same components as the" "" "vaccine" "" "approved since 1996 and the vaccines" "" "vaccines" "" "since 1997." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same illnesses, but Twinet adults and twrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet Adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix left between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six months and a 12 month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, mating (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 The European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the immunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the time of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a vaccine is vaccinated both for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunological persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory with no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection moulds, appropriate medical treatment and monitoring options should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylaktic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccination scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the priming, so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneously because in these cases intramuscular administration may lead to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered at the same time in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined Maser- mumps-Rötles vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mating, gastroenteritis, headache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the former thiomercial and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the tolerance of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mating on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.1% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects following the dose of a dose of 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects having received the Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects that had been vaccinated using the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mating was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix compared with 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and mating was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- and 11-year-old vaccines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units forming inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses received Ambirix and 147 the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 individuals whose immunogenicity was valuable, the serum levels (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3-dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the full inoculation of the vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were at the time of primacy between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-old it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the launch of a combined diphtheriac, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza virus (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotectant and seroconversion rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes both before and after resuspension.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not be fully protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccination doses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the vaccine time), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be imparted.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itchy rashes, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has already had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination using Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective constituents per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected in people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child will undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take further medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has received / has received / has or has planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be administered pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market, CHMP believes that the benefits-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via Gastrostomieslauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) respectively a nasal secretion (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonotherapy could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste saversion, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Ammony in patients with malfunctions of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammony was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rareness of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when in the anamnesis there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine carbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine synthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be given to patients with swallowing problems as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each pill AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as for clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occur through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of the neural multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined if phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, anestopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be accepted to produce phenylphenylbutyrate biased between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen for each gram consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues during the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen precipitation (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the onset of hyperammonic encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygote form of the ornithine ocarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonic encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous dose of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Following different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the majority of patients with urea cyclic disturbances or haemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the Micronucleus test results, nitric butyrate had no plasterous effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets yet, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a gastropostomy or a nasal secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine carbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-tles were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) before the birth, lesions in the brain cells of the brain cortex came to lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, anestopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram consumed between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible during treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium lauric butyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory investigations are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium nitric butyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you may not use AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, leaving the hearing, disorientation, memory impairment and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with any dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube left in the arteries to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Biometrudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to authorize the placing of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST) infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency interventions or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a second row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous cleus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus-administration of angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the doses are administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT once again testing the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivaliant Bolus without dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hirodine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivaliddin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most hemorrhages on arterial puncture points occur in the case of PCI patients, in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), bleeding may occur throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudin can be achieved again prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic or thrombocyte units) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudin with platelet units or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated leparin or ennoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivaliant Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently on adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrodine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reducing the haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding centre, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivaliant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliant Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently on adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudin can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinocular inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as the anion base region of thrombin, regardless of whether the thrombine is present in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, Bivaliant with serum levels of serum induced thrombocytopenia / heparininducized thrombocytopenia / heparininducized thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce platelet-aggregates.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is proven by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography in 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 arms arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Primary analysis and results from ACUITY study for the 30-month and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol (before the angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30 days and 1 year risk difference for combined ischemic end point and its components for patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperito-neal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reduction of the hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are represented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reevaluation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination is performed in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminale half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, preclinical data do not detect any specific dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10-cases of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects caused by a longer-term physiological strain in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to that in clinical application, even with very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of ready-to-use solution 17 is not carried out under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin Repulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration of action than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">In combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, Apidra has been studied in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged 4 to 17.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot be processed effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisp.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% compared to 0.30% compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a licence for placing Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or administered subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes in the effect of the activity, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the need for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 insufficient dosing or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of one patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment diagram is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifylline, Propoxyphene, Salizyl and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effects of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, clonidine, Guanthidin and Reserpin, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not interfere with breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the undesirable drug interactions known from clinical trials are sorted according to system organclasses and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin levels occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin delivery in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionately increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was evident from the data that a comparable postprandial glycaemic control was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal than with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was applied 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mioves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin Repulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and in comparison with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
