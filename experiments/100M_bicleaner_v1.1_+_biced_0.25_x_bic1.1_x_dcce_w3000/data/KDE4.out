if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated in place of the entire URL ;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not have to make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert texts to translate directly .
package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , by making them more readily available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map memory tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page which has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module viewing filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ ger filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and then open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : one element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colors and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles may be used ( whereby , consequently , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) .
in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View performance algorithms , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . it is drawn as a frame for the ne@@ sted entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left . here it is to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ rent branches .
you can set the minim@@ ized area for an entry over the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the module image gallery , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the image gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails in every line in the gallery .
to view the file name of the image , specify whether the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to display the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .

in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders shall be included .
in the File Sel@@ ection in HTML @-@ file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ folders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can set with a slider or a turn field , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
copy the original pictures to copy the original pictures into the gallery .
use the comment text box to use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth to the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under the navigation pane or with the key short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are accessing a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the M@@ SI@@ E indicator for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry Setup ... you can set the scope of information about the browser and operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with base image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE image plu@@ gins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . guide to login to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edited ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply type the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; edited ; will also use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the upper@@ most folder containing images as a base folder . &amp; edited ; views any sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; edited ; Dur@@ ability recur@@ sively checks the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this allows you to insert one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change that by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the shell mode of your camera , it may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help menu aid raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Properties and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ ates . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; edited ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , K@@ Photos Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can store a picture in another part of the al@@ ben@@ edi@@ m , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ cy settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ bian characteristics or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album .
if you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Im@@ ports images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album Im@@ porting screen shot .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group them under a common name . the collection used by you is used to sort your photos , when you choose Collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums sort by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date .
the buttons El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do so , first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture on the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; edited ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album in the picture window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Select All thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change about settings digi@@ ti@@ zed . select here the albums page and customize the area preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you allow the mouse cursor to take a moment over a picture , the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all that was digi@@ ti@@ zed ; goes . albums and keywords allows you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing using a photo by right @-@ clicking the F@@ 4 image ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; edited ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by holding the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ master ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can do this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My data @-@ list ; organizes your photos on the basis of data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days are shown .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ lies ; so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords will be re @-@ imported when the database is lost ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will be the under@@ score of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by right click and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key &quot; quot ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , right click the image and select it in the context menu As album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag it to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button to preview the images and select from the context menu keywords .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to him . in this way you can select a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ ately adjustable hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ras@@ er search box is a small lamp that turns green when the search finds hits . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search hasn &apos;t found , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will be able to save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results are displayed in My Search List in the main window . the text box Save As is used to change your query to My Search List . if you want to change your selection after the search , just select the corresponding entry from My Search List and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select as advanced search , the dialog box will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . find more information in the section The Tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam , s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are line @-@ by @-@ line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group can be deleted . additionally , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they conform . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar one . by using a sponge the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it . move it down while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ data folder .
&amp; digi@@ master ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window will be opened . if you are back in the edited window , you can quickly open the light table with L Tools lumin@@ escent table .
from the preview tool@@ bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy is to be seen in which window area . if you want to synchron@@ ize preview of the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , they are also executed in the other picture . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out of a picture series . if you are using pair mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ escent table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you recognize on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you must click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; click the mouse to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both pictures when you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers any part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , backup , evaluate , group , backup , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital portfolio management records , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to use a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ died ; . the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the metadata in &amp; digi@@ master &apos;s creation page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . it makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let us now with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalog pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then it will automatically mount the tree for you or place the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , because each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to just let you see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you this the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the french Nor@@ mans 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream of associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to the label and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving at speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innumerable and will still be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information . this then displays the photos at the reception site . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : links with the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples for this may be titles such as : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others .
the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you may not take longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications reading the cor@@ rupted data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks .
in short : discs remain the longest if you are operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of defect , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also get data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t make a big difference , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy slots and er@@ ases the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , please make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of just a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when there is a power failure . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . finally , you should remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more dramatically . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you should one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one ever seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss of not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to minor damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no one has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not fully saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry about data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . so , backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention will always mean not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , keep associated X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the fewer variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
now virtualization is available to everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing the size of the system .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resident / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is made from year to year easier .
GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation in hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may possibly be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the &apos; 9@@ 0s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ Converter ; a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ls@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP works because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera body , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; edited , then you should add the metadata again . these may be trun@@ cated by the other programs .
protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an Album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a ready @-@ to @-@ use indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; edited ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking the button download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected button selected is as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new download option is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; edited . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded .
the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder . the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must select them first and use them to delete the selected delete option .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted ; if you want to completely delete the camera finder , you should do this via the camera menu , since this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names if you upload photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch to the date &amp; time option for further adjustments . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option Camera File Name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case when downloading . or in capital letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ed ; used for a photo , will be displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ master ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; this is used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case , &amp; edited , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ kam asks you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code , users who want to locate the place of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . so , the question is actually more about how the data is in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; edited . to access these settings , you must select the Settings dialog . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set to be previ@@ ew@@ ed or image editing will be set . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . also in a database synchron@@ isation these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is syn@@ onymous with the author &apos;s line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the picture that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without going lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file has been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Ref@@ resh button to the right of each category .
each time you open the LED , these settings will be switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size loading quot ; you should only use on fast hosts . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you are using picture editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing mode , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option you can switch the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
save los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the los@@ sy option , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference causes a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that is photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as a penet@@ rating white . finally , you can try to resolve some parts of the missing information from the sky@@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recon@@ struc@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adapted individually for each picture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ cra@@ w provides you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color ef@@ acts at the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , since it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information as to translate colour information from a color space to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / start color management module with raw files .
color profile folders Fol@@ der the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to store your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you want to use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correc@@ ting conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your picture would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for what is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and they are then edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting a picture and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly navig@@ ated through &amp; edited , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button changes .
you can also include the display of the Welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; under certain circumstances , this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ died ; .
the Set@@ ting When starting new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam , search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam will ask you if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited , to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; edited ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and improve your photos . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or using the context menu for preview and selecting the entry / Edit entry .
the Image Processing includes a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to section editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you have saved the File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or using the button Dis@@ connect image processing restore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save .
almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or restoring undo by selecting Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should refer to the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB file over the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions between them will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you &apos;ve made any changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and zoom into the picture in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the list menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically choose the magni@@ fying factor
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will be shown in the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can view this in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the edited dialog . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire phrases . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Edit menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ master ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again to the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible , which means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC marking field in other applications , you should pay attention to these limitations .
after you have commented on it , either use the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button . with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files , but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords tree and a selection box with the keywords used before .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set in the tree by marking the corresponding check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and searches . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drop and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to guide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is on K@@ 1 keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right key @-@ tree to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created a rule and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have adapted it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors coming from your camera or scanner will have a predictable departure from the actual photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you can make informed choices at any point of the image processing workflow . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should one use a different color space and thus have to think about ink management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to connect your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor is on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either have to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before trying any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ trast Enh@@ anced from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ rolls the lumin@@ osity values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or full .
comparison : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity coefficient of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundaries and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
contrast enhancement : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in the rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the configuration of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
to the right above you see a hist@@ ogra@@ m that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color selected for calculating the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly that . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save it to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to consult the Color Management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the color correction menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so you can use it for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ine filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was developed when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically feasible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and this works the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ a ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers , especially those that shoot hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can un@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your adjustments can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce sati@@ ety instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument sound correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here . more concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes .
the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear imaging is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as with the inputs . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Lo@@ ad : with these buttons the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shade , medium and sun tones . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fiable Channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a c@@ rank to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
preview the original photos is to see a red marker . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly that . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer in the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well as you can also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer then is THE tool to create great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color channel . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first reduce the color bre@@ wing .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . you can store any bl@@ ender setting for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is to be seen under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good in all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
orange filter : simulated a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ ath@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) squ@@ am@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ master ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep your attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly en@@ circles the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio previously .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this goes even in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
using the &amp; digi@@ master ; tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plate App@@ ly in Image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder to the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the templates files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
there are three buttons below which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template on your image . the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ master ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process requires colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images have often used a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers are already using a focus aid while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the focus on sharpen@@ ing . you can call this with the menu entry Cor@@ rection .
but you should handle this carefully because the results do not seem very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image is re@@ focused . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft@@ mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren LY@@ C@@ TION and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase of the radius or the amount enhance the effect .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from shar@@ per and therefore beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool attempts to create an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focus quot ; in which it revers@@ es the image . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus mostly reaches better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focus colors in image editing .
the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixels that are far from original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will add the image even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ ß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ ß &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the tri@@ mming , color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimum Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original non @-@ sharp color image that needs to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing knob sets the sharp@@ ness of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove any art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smooth and sharp , details should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the focus should always be subordin@@ ated to direction depen@@ dency .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be placed higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs .
integral stepping width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stepping width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it happen .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly that . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and have a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts removed . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is an odd black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to as@@ certain lumin@@ ance changes . if it is raised , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . this value improves the filter frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls colour tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more strongly ro@@ mp@@ ed , but also sp@@ ells out the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the alignment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is lifted , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high a s@@ me@@ aring occurs . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft@@ mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren LY@@ C@@ TION and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
these filters to restore gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that emerge in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digital@@ ised images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture translation . texture translation is performed with another tool , image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly that . each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and have a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the button at any time .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film grain on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph , which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scann@@ ed illumination and photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel to remove photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ress for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and thumb@@ nails will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all pre@@ views .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : an average of neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot light the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ el@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise un@@ har@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by motion .
with the great exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction filter and with three further control of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light refresh@@ ment at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of gravity fourth correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth grade . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value scales the image size and thereby correc@@ ts the first graph . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the spher@@ ical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best , perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the File Transformation menu or remove the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and picture is to correct the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the sound @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ e.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add film gran@@ ul@@ ator if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter cine is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ dation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film effect effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting creates the look of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage ze . the lines whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose for yourself to sket@@ ch out . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen height and the lower knob evalu@@ ates the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ master ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equ@@ als 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses proprietary proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look like it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects with the button at any time .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses proprietary proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ om@@ atic camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and blur@@ rings it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and create it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation using the button at any time .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops to your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture .
you can keep editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or rotating in the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ forming Dre@@ es or Trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many picture editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ate was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
retained aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be placed higher than 3 .
the mem@@ bs save as and loads are used exactly . each insertion for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation using the button at any time .
you can see below an example of photo blowing by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard aug@@ mentation for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . image editing allows you to create a picture . to trim a photo you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply holding it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The Image Processing button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut to fit ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save or Save file entries under the File menu to save the edited photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
depending on the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it &apos;s always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically cent@@ red the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help enable help to fade in so that you can put together your images better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bows , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers .
the golden center provides liquid auxiliary lines if you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
the gold spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ country rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow along this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ al@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ontal Options and Ver@@ tical mirr@@ oring options can be used to reflect the harmonious divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free press is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it will happen easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function trans@@ formers tri@@ mming from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Automati@@ cally Cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas generated by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas generated by the transformation , in pixels .
turn left corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed zone .
right top corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed zone .
turn left corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
turn right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture gets a bit covered . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you will get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
the sh@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ oring tool to adjust your picture .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single lubrication , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two loops create twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has jag@@ ged tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done on the basis of file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will change . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section , you can find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s release can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , you can read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section , you can find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supporting cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in avi or m@@ peg format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understand these formats and will not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; edited ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playing the program .

many tools you need to make photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ as , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected panel .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties page shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it . move it down while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette Palette you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folders to files .
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select it . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box in the Ad@@ min Cur@@ sor button is selected under the Color button , the color is inserted from the color board at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and In@@ sert .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ . die &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ comp@@ uted the graph and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; posters ; opening or graphs in &amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; open in a &amp; posters ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than this node )
further required software : &amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without any argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been modified by a different program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later it will be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; also , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ g@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you can choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ visi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the Setup dialog .
at program start you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that comes to a page should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Rec@@ t Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or leave the program each time .
the Open site gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the session already running ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the session management page allows you to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or decide to be asked every time you start .
the context menu , which appears normally with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up further options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z include :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . it produces representations according to the spring @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for un@@ coated graphs . it uses the fru@@ cht@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circul@@ arly according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms change special options , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ er@@ eted graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ g@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it requires the following program packages :
a special set @-@ up is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner powered by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values with reduced drag to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , otherwise some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window will appear to set the image file options . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 , or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected a screen shot in the Import &gt; Screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options already described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above dialog appears . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains natural data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . put your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates a higher deviation for the GPS time and camera direction . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data of one place for pictures , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region concerned and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the scan tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below it will appear the al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images . choose a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Reiter for preview images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window is not closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format below without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases as no compression of color information takes place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please view exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ cryp@@ tion Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG En@@ ver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image output . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . afterwards , you can create the module via Extras MPEG En@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set as next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file in the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start generating the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you &apos;re back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right below .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ mb@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to generate the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to process your images frequently or further use them further , you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images via the Add images button . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag images to the image list and place it there to add the images to be sent .
with the Pictures button , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures selected by you are attached as attachments .
do not send too many images at one time . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the comments are made in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Image File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original read@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the pictures in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it using Es@@ c ; Canc@@ el .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the pictures are displayed in random order . so it is not used in the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 ms correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through them , see the picture . as you can see by comparing them with the picture , there are entries in each group , i.e. persons , places and group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see the picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both people are shown are displayed . through this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view preview images to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture every person has the same icon in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage of allowing you to display symbols with pictures of persons while also showing a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the picture view window ( described in more detail ) and select the picture for the appropriate person in the context menu . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the picture again .
if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here you can see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the fast entry , screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you would like to print out this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed items Pre@@ view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in preview screen ) and the time line always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create through the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ectiv@@ es . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created that can be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not have any more images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . to allow the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have related all three to base folders or URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be specified in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not happen again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ photo@@ album . you can import them into your database . image properties are imported with and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the pictures in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double manner . first it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the .@@ k@@ im file will be searched . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML Export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can invoke through the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you wish to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of people belonging to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called for your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example is shown in the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will review the different steps from ( 1 ) App@@ ly the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options .
on the left you will see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view the viewer &apos;s options . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium as explained in .
in the list of choices you choose , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . see the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which can be accessed via the module itself .
because the modules are used together by several applications together , it may be possible that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always try new modules with the demo database first before using this on your own pictures . the demo database can be either accessed via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that share the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , allowing some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : here &apos;s an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so if you have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . at the moment you don &apos;t have a lot of information , because you don &apos;t have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by doing so , move the names used up , find the people faster and classi@@ fy them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon after the list .
if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images to your comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are placed under the thumb@@ nail on the upper right .
if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . beware , this requires that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then close the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have not set filters . an example of this is shown here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will be shown in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you wish to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you can use the pictures anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back into it . if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid the inter@@ locking of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make accessible to others and click on the latest view lock in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see , and choose the menu entry All out of up @-@ to @-@ date view .
with this you have determined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will hide all the images you have locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to for@@ f@@ eit the view to private pictures .
the reason you want to spend all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered in the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop them with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the appropriate entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can be moved into full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image . for the zo@@ oming , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out zoom out with the plus and minus key .
with the turn functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this is not working with videos . you can make notes on the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with characteristics while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features placed on your images , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever selected , then simply bookmark all of the images you want to copy to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you have categories in particular preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after selecting the image . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you can copy &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can rever@@ t your painted later .
in order to disable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wi@@ re@@ model views is yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all subjects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
when del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take over these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or reject the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the object displayed with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in property view .
press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render one part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a visibility level as a wi@@ re@@ model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window instructions and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or under an existing view , drag the cover to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the image to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to order multiple views on top of each other , drag the b@@ assist in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card guides at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the drop down to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the front panel .
to close a view click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere .
you can save the current window view with the View window ordering ... Store . there will be a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 topical . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon to render the rendering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can paste as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; render settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; icon in the tool@@ bar or select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View modes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the following dialog will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but make sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the size of the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the picture section to render to the input fields .
in the quality drop down sel@@ ector you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling moves the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are comp@@ uted by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 4 pixels will be charged , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and tested for further sub @-@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final option for rendering quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; not yet complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . insert the path to your retention and version here . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file exists in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wi@@ re@@ model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you check high detail faith@@ fulness for extended projections , all the wi@@ re@@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property provides a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a bottom is nar@@ rowed down below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window instructions or create new window instructions . in the window instructions section , it explains how to create and save window instructions .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window instructions . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window setup when starting the program .
the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window instructions . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Clear .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just got &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image .
if you have installed everything wrong you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window setup :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bars . read the documentation to get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
they will often have to use these menus and icons , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button to a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the App@@ ly button or enter the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; it actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the En@@ ter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite end . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . you will then see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material , because you have to enter settings for the pigment . always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on thumb@@ nail .
if you don &apos;t see any color on a fa@@ der and ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then click the Pre@@ view .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose one colour each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step , as you have already understood the basic principles of work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor down one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now offers a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . like on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select Er@@ stes Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on ball pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the En@@ ter key .
the gloss effect and reflection results in some partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved store are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last @-@ hand command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used do undo .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option , you can change default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return button .
you can set whether every picture should be displayed in a separate window , or if all the images always want to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialog Bo@@ ard@@ - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ piece ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ piece ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu entry reports you problems or desires . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to enter the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ piece ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you will need to set up the show@@ picture in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise , the colors should be in contrast with what you should indicate in contrast . exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer do than scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer do than scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this webpage : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel and exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan an image , the user can only launch a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and par@@ l@@ ly will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving must be selected a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; saving images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog prior to each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; these automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically generated images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the About starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; the Settings button shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking into the player window and selecting Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... selecting the button short@@ cut in the player window and setting short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up any existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . thus , you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general features which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to help the user know why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error 53 = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most script languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ sts the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now query the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths sliding the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example , for example storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be loaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the configuration of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . you might just search for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which ones you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter any problems , please report it to the mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script for compile time . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
de@@ bug Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up easily via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
to view the player window , the player window will also turn on or off in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when moving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; then enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist on the end of the playlist .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / un@@ roll to keep the each running piece in the visible window area .
when changing to the context browser , switch automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray presented section . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
playback when starting causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD color for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for selecting colors . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to adjust how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the inter@@ sec@@ ted and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the play@@ lists browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current play if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send playing pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows you &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve the same performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok just needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work hard . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by following in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer using bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also mount the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open when you crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l : &quot; the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2 tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be ignored . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error there if you want to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist will appear . how do tunes come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub @-@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the review column must be shown in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column show rating . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop them there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button will be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be noisy which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format .
it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat res@@ p k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mix@@ ers ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( eg . sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can not simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers respond to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all components . register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t work , you can also ask for the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all the ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with drag @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report this to us at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm command this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current title if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ usable d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . tap on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button plays a piece in the queue sequence in the queue . pressing the input key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can &apos;t be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read , change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ head , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual score on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by right clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the item and press : selecting or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the metadata dialog .
developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click New Design to install ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you must re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without shr@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also needs to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output , enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a board with onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter the us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course enjoy this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed car@@ er for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide should be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . use the mouse to drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the Play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist browser . in addition , when the playlist is in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you can find various ways to load the playlist .

if you install these packages using a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you will need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that can capture and browse your entire music collection .
in this chapter we explain how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
the player window also includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , larger window .
below the running text display are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t be afraid of the abundance of features that are easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main sections , the navigation pane is on the left . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays various information about the current play . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpretation . these three sub @-@ windows are later replaced in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window will be blown away . the information shown there has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title , you can see the title of the piece , the artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon next to it . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z @-@ symbol you can find further information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display cover pictures in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the pictures may have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover pictures that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played instantly .
among the selected pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section displays the five most rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in each area to start playback right away . you can also right @-@ click on it and select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of scrip@@ ting scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . to do so , no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - Only the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there is another division according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different artists .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically , and the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box , with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry gives you the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer the pieces to the Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the garbage dump ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition , after which it will appear among different artists .
up@@ lift composite marking - Chan@@ ges a new album marked as a composition back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be shown under different artists but again under the associated interpreter .
the Play@@ list browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required tracks from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you will find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z for example , you can listen to music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert the selected files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist maintains all of the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries into the desired position with the mouse . once you enter letters there , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one in two , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three are found ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ a little search for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ clicking in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you can add the Add button to add pieces to the playlist . right next to it , you can save play@@ lists , empty playlist blank and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window using the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is shown , a slider for the play@@ time and the playing time of the current play .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status bar option in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visualization of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can launch them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details of setting up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Lo@@ ad . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes Zu@@ fäl@@ liger Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately complete your play@@ lists and you can start playing directly . the Play@@ list Rec@@ re@@ eds start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .

played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , you will be able to add random pieces from any of the featured play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by running the script and then click on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package will be installed for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing custom scripts , please refer to the writing scripts section .

if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when encoding the MP3 , you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ c@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original in the image file , you will be asked for an empty cd media to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , run q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the library search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback , access community help from the forums and learn new news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : does all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also includes &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - und En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ A@@ ger : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it may make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ames for the project file .
saves all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for each single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and change . also , you can ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what should happen with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it will be asked what should happen with it as if you had called file closing .
if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files that are added appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? -@@ Rem@@ edy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can create only one image from a CD , which you can then burn sometime later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . you should also choose cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can create only one image from a DVD , which you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the pressing button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the Content View , but can also be used single @-@ sided . it contains information about the used video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is shown in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents are shown in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the Content View allows selection and dra@@ gging of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment for it further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct authori@@ z@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work for strai@@ gh@@ tening . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , therefore your taste and style of your task is crucial , which of the included programs you give preference .
in this chapter we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; chi@@ ef@@ ly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void Q@@ Val@@ u@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void rendering C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XXXX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String parent ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ID )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; cho@@ osen for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these WAV files ( these enco@@ ders need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to crack the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying the copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( but the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retri@@ eving information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually captured .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . see the step by step example for more information on how to use this program as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the C@@ DD@@ B request of CD data according to the set up of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog , the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that the enco@@ der in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already expi@@ red file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; exit ) .
open the main setup dialog for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the enco@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ things is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually be acceptable to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title String &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator have to be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = but@@ ton@@ hole in assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it &apos;s important to note that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( meaning of translation : this is the author ) bin not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select an address field ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirr@@ oring servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not happened yet .
for storing the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . first , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) are displayed on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . thereby &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are still unsure of what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found with a search engine , as it is not considered to be completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what is to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with every read on a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is transferred to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the / etc / f@@ stab file and an attempt with the device descriptions exist for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . in order to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD should get ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls re@@ boot the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your host )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this then / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously deco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or a core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for every read on a &amp; CD ; if you choose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section .
because we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos look a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers by Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; field , unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for each of the comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
note : after a successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the Help to the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the data anyway . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you will return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BO@@ M list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches on or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
if you click on the selection selection to start reading the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read directly on the disk . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in the case of weak machines , the result is unclear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is going to be part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous package from there . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is targeted to people who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hi , still to read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? whoever reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; apart from others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop to drag and drop all MIDI files from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically detects the process used .
session support . when you end &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start playing with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this works also with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which one song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke lyrics . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event , select the entries of the text or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in line . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize ... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . keep in mind when adding a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it will again appear the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke lyrics .
to skip a song , select the next song next song , next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right .
to reverse a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not stored when it is loaded .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map translated General @-@ MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map that converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano events in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary for each occurrence to have a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to show that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section speci@@ fies how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the par@@ ity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun@@ shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , in which each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
keywords are mainly used to map tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the maps provided .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to replace the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP segment has 16 lines numbered between 0 and 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies , in which ratio pitch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event is sent with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM speci@@ fies that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to play a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer gives you a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t feel like adding all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before , make sure to enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn on Automati@@ cally Add to Collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it inspir@@ es me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ var @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anybody . I would like to stress that I just keep using programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
thanks also Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ var / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; use the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card besides that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send a error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , then you should use the Last@@ ing playlist category .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose play@@ lists from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ shell ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the package testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; S@@ MEs ; supported .
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ Player ; it can even include the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
thus the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ MB ; module as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if it was determined ) , this must be done by typing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , it should play phon@@ on all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the S@@ MB , the dialog is set in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; delete files .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it will probably be rever@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ Live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used lin@@ ux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact information should be made via the Ki@@ le ; -@@ Website .
if you have any questions , or if you want to compile a list , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . additionally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn about its possibilities , consult the manual of Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters directly .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master correctly , good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ Avail@@ able .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that defines the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ locker , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick @-@ entry Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ ue ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be done some settings related to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , writing &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : with this the encoding of the system is set . modern systems use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is only a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see more areas of a green text on the screen , it is probably noticed that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with automatic execution of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the add @-@ in line to lock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( apart from the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the image search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked on in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . the preliminary search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as it was cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is spra@@ yed .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
quick @-@ installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is shown on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; range , and there is no call to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quick &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , you should see the three large selection fields . the selection fields have been developed for quick inclusion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is available for quick inclusion of the document in parts , chapters , sections ...
the selection box For further information , please refer to articles such as keywords , notes or references . the options available are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or another element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( choose a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector ) .
when using quotation marks a selection list with a literary index . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it works only if the file belongs to a project . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ cks ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ lis@@ e is used for determining the font size . it can be used to specify the font size for the main text , the notes notes , etc . there are the following letters to be used :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two options available : 1 . the Wi@@ zard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the volume building or the push of a button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically removes the file .
if it fails to compile the document , it should be searched for errors . if it is not the case , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . if , for example , a report with the font number 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the creation of the font inside the surrounding area .
changes are made only within the environment ( by \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no restrictions ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { post@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , now follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; .
as soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be done . for this purpose , a quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion can begin in other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preferred search permits the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; just setup modern under Settings box ... Tools Buil@@ dings are selected .
to search for the advance search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on to advance search . the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI ; the viewer is then executed .
with this feature in &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
should an error occur when using the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if there is an error , it will be summ@@ ar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the log file reports the source code in the source code . in the editor , the buttons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between errors . the logging file always indicates the line in which the error appears . to view the incorrect line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the incorrect line .
once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting a file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings General can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated setup of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; posters ; used &amp; posters ; as internal editor . &amp; posters ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin with reading the chapter works with the Editor of &amp; Plac@@ ards .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference that can be called using La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as its syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many wizard may trigger additional jump marks . this is a special type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ ue Edi@@ ting Mark@@ s or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cuts enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also emphasizes the jump mark , so that it is automatically translated when entering a mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sts ; already offers outstanding opportunities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source always supported many environments and groups , and therefore supported &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selecting are the following commands to choose the text selection :
it includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides an empty line ) . with a paragraph does not mean a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an advanced meaning as this command also has an extended meaning , as this command will end with a back@@ s@@ lash ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be balanced first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit removal , the following commands are included to delete the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit selecting paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edi@@ ting environment for a more convenient work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command termin@@ ates the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded close bracket .
if the cursor is in front or behind the sof@@ ter bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many sh@@ aded groups braces can quickly get lost over . this command closes the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a tool . the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used in &amp; boxes ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and completes two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic add @-@ on of the double bond can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use ad @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; En@@ ter key &amp; ki@@ cks ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but also the \ \ item command .
in a table environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ending line breaks .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be under Settings box ; Set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to reach this . if this tab is not the one , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already a good source code completion offers , this was added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , different modes are installed . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic execution . all these modes can be set for different ways of working under Settings Ki@@ le ... Complete setup .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for text ) .
on the back of the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and stran@@ gely da@@ un@@ ts the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , ski@@ pping marks can be added , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible using the edit boun@@ cing brand names and the desired parameters can then be saved .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list boxes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as holders of the general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to complete mode will have a large e list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the execution of environments .
when invo@@ king the full @-@ done environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient conditions can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set Up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of execution mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of cuts that can be replaced immediately with strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , where the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated over the menu bar or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key , the character L is replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large @-@ scale books are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many people in one document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete compensation for all written requests .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... En@@ able boxes . here , also the threshold value for the display of the execution can be specified .
the loaded files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the personal home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphic art dialog forms the creation of graphics as easy as possible . in order to review the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are grouped in groups in the Gener@@ ate compilation , create conversion and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file using Alt ; 4 and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick@@ fitting command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... Hier@@ bei uses the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function by &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows for the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not yet been developed yet and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; boxes ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . it includes a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ Live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and documents supplied and here a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or impact candidates . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit them in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , an arbitrary signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will get you a ; empty signatures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and paste in the bottom section your new signature . signature example Kon@@ qi con@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file storage or click on the disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove file or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .
select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button below and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the folder , then exit the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; html files are deleted every time you run mein@@ pro@@ c .
as I said before , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply let the current working folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be ha@@ unted . if not , delete the file on current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .

specify the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start editing the Edit menu with the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; -@@ Element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to one another . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze Sch@@ eme . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see further information on comments .
apart from an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that sets a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ sees can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see if such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to add comments is simple . you can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , with the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the field and sub @-@ project managers , the respective area or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and Rol@@ es names are independent of b@@ ump@@ y caps , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog comprises some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
tags : large / S@@ ump@@ y of tags : big / S@@ ump@@ y of automatically inserted tags . normal case @-@ sensitive means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / S@@ ump@@ y of attributes : large / lower case @-@ sensitive of automatically inserted attributes . normal case @-@ sensitive means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags include : when checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , it will be inserted immediately after the tag .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
automatically update start and finish tag : when turned on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , the default values can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening @-@ opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generates regular backup copies so that in case of a power ou@@ tage or crash when the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and the documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a map guide ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is passed through by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depen@@ dency of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility of displaying warnings by hooks of no more queries .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document can be set in detail .
in the area of the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings area , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are grouped in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . abbrevi@@ ations are grouped into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P &apos;s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ wer@@ case abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading Compon@@ ent in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if the information entered is correct , then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ designed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
one view , in which all hold points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without adding information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a requirement is given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , and if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include files .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .

this chapter describes how you can adjust to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and script languages as well as &amp; CSS . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag files are handy , symbolic lists of image buttons ( above the editing window ) that insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see also for details of the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a merely element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a merely element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that summ@@ ari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a merely element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a merely element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced . this will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , can be edited via D@@ TD Edit D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
this action assigned key short@@ cut . by clicking the Custom button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Even are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus uses : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced by PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is executed , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input the output of the executed application can be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , to the default output output . it can be specified , what is to be done with the text written on the default output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Gra@@ ph more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , which@@ ever is , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared by several divi@@ ders into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog on Settings Tool@@ bar . ensure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by half of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back up to the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ planted in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) to load their tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = func@@ .@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ .@@ html func@@ 1 = day 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag = tag 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = Import@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ...
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation should be displayed directly for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the Con@@ text List ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file lines list .
a simple list of context items that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you won &apos;t get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the lost resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else . in different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and use@@ able for publication . to make an airport contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the source of resources , both for our team and for later users .
when you upload , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . enter the input fields in the dialog New resource ( URL preview can be empty ) and clicking OK will start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , uploaded to the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the Author of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag@@ XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to use . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tion@@ er : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to be able to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bars over actions everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ fies the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and tool@@ bars . please check in , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can right @-@ click the file @-@ bar to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all file @-@ tra@@ cker , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS instructions to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with file managers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be carried out with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . using the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as running the script , editing , or sending mail .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and ref@@ res@@ ing the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces quickly with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached , edited and viewed for project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two box riders at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this guide displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this guide shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; transm@@ its the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what someone else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly converted to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details can be found with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; run or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are a special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift + Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained .
loading a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set using Settings ... added . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file should be fresh@@ ened without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bars is denied if that day in this location contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will de@@ activate it .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes is based on der@@ ail ; -@@ version .
select the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by external use ti@@ dy .
inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously switching between different types of interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the presentation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - web browser .
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which ones and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering text file , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension we@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web contents you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the project &apos;s main folder , let it be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
this option allows you to view all files and folders within the main folder , and you can make an exact selection according to your opinion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the hook , clips from the project .
the latest screen of the new Project Assistant provides three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or with Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in addition , troubleshooting is described .
in the Pro@@ files section , you can set high loading profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by saying one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be enabled and these actions can be added , altered or deleted . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are just as well , but the entries are opened and opened with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password saved on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best st@@ amped by the tool@@ bar menu . use and Add split . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in adding tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on this can be set either by using a context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where it can be indicated which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and setting settings ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates in principle like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions that one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select file as template save as local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File as template save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template , enter a name for the template , and secure it . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically connect to &amp; PHP , create files , or link them to them . in addition , you can keep track of some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates stored files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify a folder &apos;s behavior , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template summary . if a regular folder is set up , it would disable templates in this path in principle , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows you to create or recre@@ ate text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers through copying contents templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a full command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor available via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source editor if necessary , in which the performed changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green icon displays the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . PHP is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor runs in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke activ@@ ates the active cursor from a window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization spac@@ ing between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this is possible to edit invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cursor is as usual in a word processor , because of moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or removal key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that the insertion of tags already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other drop anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables wizard or the Listen Wi@@ zard are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigating style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style sheets can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Comp@@ ati@@ bility Mode , wai@@ ste re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g working folder is possible for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
this command will check for a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template will match any QNAP NAS that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that did a lot of work was comparing and merging folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folder
opening dialogue enables manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) , or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog opens up your selection and displays them again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if merge is enabled , the target field is active and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then begins immediately . in open dialogue , you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d have to create two appropriate files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop the dropping of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare exceptions . )
the vertical line that separates the summ@@ ation column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ alters &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then be the current group .
sometimes by automatic merging or manually editing , no more row remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps then again select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs .
in the sharing window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down ) or to the next / last un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , differences between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if it is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . be careful with this option however you might acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the clip@@ board contents .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line ending of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore it to the next start ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are shown in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to@@ asted . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically introduces an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board then falls .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when merging , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn save only a line feed character , although they are different . if this option is checked , the carriage return marks are made visible , but like a white mark . while merging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is de@@ activated in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is enabled , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
through the selection fields for the encoding , a brief reference appears , which is the local encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to use for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
switch this off to supp@@ ress premature changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color co@@ ded overview column are displayed . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
it can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge the current file into the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name . ( if this function is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal word processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used for line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient .

while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for display and merge . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge all folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File .
if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not merge . to start merging , select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
if the scanning of the folders is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that has been found during scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions and all sub@@ directories can be opened up with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the name in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . with folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are active . then Sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the option new file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to be copied . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors cannot be eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
while merging , one file will be processed by the other . status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog , the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as the target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder are also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key short@@ cut ) to merge only the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message indicating the faulty parts appears . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all the entries , a dialog window appears with the options U@@ sing , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge @-@ window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , an appropriate dialog will appear . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you can see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( at the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge function has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will be shown in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be shown in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the files are selected to merge in a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and ob@@ tains the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible while merging certain files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option Directory &amp; Text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between folder and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start folder merge . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to Er@@ le@@ bau@@ d and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder merge .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relative und@@ one or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is at present as a variation observer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by checking in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all the programmers who have gone this way or that they will go this way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly , no sr@@ c is left ; no sr@@ c is left , and the text cannot be qu@@ en@@ ched . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift insertion ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re@@ read the update folder after changes to these options . )
only entries that show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; when cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . if , however , on an application within &amp; p@@ ager ; clicking on it also appears the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On desktop and exit .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
if this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names will be labeled with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop also appears as background in the &amp; p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems only .
here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be defined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appears , as known from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as icons or with their contents and move it outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switches ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment this can &apos;t be changed in the Settings dialog . you can do this manually :

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation should be a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you &amp; K@@ likes ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ favor ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse cursor is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set @-@ in short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and dimin@@ utive &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of screen to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor resi@@ des for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is easy : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
is the smart move activ@@ ates , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can pull the pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ently shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click .
when the sound is delayed , you &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at the moment . in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already press the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be disabled first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of the position of a mouse @-@ click without any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ ling you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard hub . it can cause acci@@ dentally moving the mouse clicks without unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front rows of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to select text to copy it into the clip@@ board and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but it will probably cause them some trouble . here are some ad@@ vices :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead as follows : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when you move the move time when it is smart move . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click , but it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you need to install the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X @-@ Window ; this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and cause pain to an@@ tigen .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to set a particular time for a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . thus , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation history that should be spoken once more .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text@@ book . you can often choose the text passages used without typing it . the passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word @-@ passing . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so only correctly sp@@ elled words are included into the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a flow storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
when you mouth ; correctly setup , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the flow memory . you can select phrases that should be spoken once more .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the Setup dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ fu@@ sions and page K@@ TT@@ SD Language Service .
in the input field of the map speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding , with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ d voice service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages book menu or in the list of text passages .
with the selection of text , the selected text passage is discussed directly and additionally inserted into the flow storage . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can determine whether the text passages book should be saved automatically when you close the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text pass@@ book . if you choose to reject any changes , the text pass@@ book is not saved . select Before saving , it will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ itory contains a list of dictionary words for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
choose the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the dictionary . the frequency of the individual words is simply as@@ cer@@ tained by counting the appearance . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how to wei@@ ghted them .
with this option you create a new empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly inserted words automatically inserts in the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages books is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add promotions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the c@@ un@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow gro@@ in in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is arranged by default on the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the c@@ un@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the map voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eboard folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to split the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ jah and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax happily swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional note has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ jah / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the Voice Output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but that depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text output by the computer . it is stored a list of spoken sentences , which the user can spend time and time again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; posters ; , even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other formats .
speech output is performed via speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , Festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language outputs on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ t@@ d over kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; posters ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ en mailing list . subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ browsers .
before you can use , you must install and correctly set program speech speech .
on the first start of kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card interface speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card map is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher would otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
clicking on the card @-@ card @-@ front speaker in kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will display the card interface speaker . it will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on this button with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the actors in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a young and female voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the map menu will appear . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card will be shown and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar &apos;s system area , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the map sheet is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check there Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read and select the Text Editor main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the extended text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read and select the Text Editor main menu . then the voice output should start .
this works also when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system at &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fies you about the events you specified . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file that is part of the package by &amp; kt@@ ts is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech tool speech . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain fla@@ ws of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the way it works , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and continues these orders . if the display of the screen reader is read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
breaking news is the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a lengthy text on a web page can be read , you can communicate with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text jobs . each job you order from the map card is a text job . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text jobs . text jobs are meant for the output of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are handled in queue , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such template will stop this output and exit .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text jobs as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in future there can be more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined string substitute filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons like : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ S@@ LT files are included for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the map speaker for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , the filter continues to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the next setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for setting string translation filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ Set . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can get the application ID of running programs with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; s &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may just type it .
the string replace filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. meaning the words must be limited by separ@@ ator ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in di@@ alogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions .
trans@@ formers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such forming . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
the speaker selection filter lets you send text to a specific speaker set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can set text from a female voice to be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program speci@@ fies the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected which matches the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your ch@@ aff settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; Windows . start kt@@ t@@ d in one window , then kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other window .
none of the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers mentioned support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phones , so that S@@ able works at all . you must do that even if you do not have this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only chew@@ ing f@@ ading is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a character string filter .

if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ Patch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; get it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ bug under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . so , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer for supported languages . see also on kt@@ ts webpage ; for information not included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for information or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the SPD @-@ conf shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech pat@@ chers is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can rec@@ ede pro@@ posi@@ tional or set @-@ up , repeat , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in after .
when you click on the Add @-@ in speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map menu speaker setup will be shown . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding text that will be passed to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be performed automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set the volume , voice speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and display this gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be selected .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set gets syn@@ thes@@ ized quicker ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ gram symbol appears in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed phrase . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed from default or backward in the order listed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio board audio . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types by &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ cm ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . in order for these adjustments to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the display of the screen reader has been read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
breaking news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces news . if you let &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who enters the room just .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the conduc@@ tive sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory note will be played in front of the introductory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text jobs . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ mu@@ ts@@ .@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card list noti@@ fications appears .
select this check box to enable &amp; k@@ de reading ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the characteristics of the speaker you want here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the map speaker as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the speed or sound settings in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100 , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and set limit detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds split text into individual phrases . this can &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre@@ reading starts , because only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit det@@ ecting filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more set @-@ level detection filter , but beginners will get rid of it .
the easiest way to learn is to select the speaker selection by selecting . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel texts on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
string recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab tags are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set of by@@ laws , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the map menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ are Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can over@@ ride the speakers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card interface speaker ) . in other words : no spokes@@ persons are defined .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field speaker , which is most likely to clear the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use speaker that matches the following .
in this case 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; has been terminated . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by using G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console ; appears a message saying : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find clu@@ es to possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ mu@@ gr@@ gram doesn &apos;t display this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ t@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / bind / apps / kt@@ t@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ oes such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for speakers . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the voice speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reading . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set the speaking speed up .
I don &apos;t manage that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file ren@@ ames the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a character string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the map fron@@ ter orders will be shown , the order consists of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ st@@ .org )
some users experience the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
with July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read even more .
the so@@ x audio program is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but is otherwise not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check whether your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , voice speed , and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phones .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phones . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the GNU / Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on your distribution &apos;s CDs .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this phone . festival generated by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts .
in this process additional w@@ rap@@ pers code will be added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Fol@@ der , but in the Fol@@ der / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; requires either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you will not need to re@@ compile the error correc@@ tions , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the german de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to output the language via festival with a Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can not adjust pitch , volume or speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console , on the command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a standardized , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ Package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be already functioning and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options gray are displayed , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , by clicking on the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab on the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog device can be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask , the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the host console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . de@@ activating an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will release this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows for a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be grouped by selection of entries and additions or gra@@ ding in the list with the kno@@ bs Hin@@ auf or Her@@ der in priority .
clicking on the Add ... button from the group machine to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the name known machine describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains names known by name , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP still in the test is to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Ob@@ jects machine will be shown .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; kon@@ os ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; additionally , the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second one will discuss all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is im@@ par@@ ted .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future , so this description is currently being focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is assign@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be arbitr@@ arily selected !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 45 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally converted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it provides the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar that provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective extraction . the second goal was to answer a question my wife posed : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ool the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . don &apos;t know &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , it searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . sets your tape drive before you can format it before being used . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band name and the capacity &amp; k@@ dat ; with the tape format@@ ting continues . all data on the tape are lost thereby ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the check process has been started , the dialog appears for check . in this dialog , you can review your selection once more and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and time remaining .
before you can re@@ connect the restore , the files to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the restore menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can review your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , dialog returns . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup file :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , which are stored on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the other files .
exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before tar calling . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded when releasing &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option from flo@@ ppy cre@@ ators .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ port block size for the tape drive to be changed . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a log viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system is storing the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the system log - to open the system log . if this is not shown , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not having system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criteria or after entered strings . enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the process name and log in the filter bar to show the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as the protocol lines of the stage hint . the color display of protocol rows can be switched off .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example , in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the Process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new record lines that are added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log on the menu in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you can find more recent information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of program starts at boot @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . that &apos;s because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V in@@ it without a new installation and re@@ format . the Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when you boot the system or change to another run@@ time . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is started only once .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the in@@ it in different places and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ time is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial section :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you will be able to repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between levels or move the position within a level by dra@@ gging it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry will be removed from its original run@@ time ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new range . in order to copy them to a new round level , you need to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the item number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ time , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ time with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry manually , press the En@@ ter button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts to restart constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the standard run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after you &apos;ve made changes , you need to save it . either you use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or the Save button in the File menu .
the main window consists of two map @-@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a map on which you can set individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the password management card box appears if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD .
this map only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable to the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restriction .
the card card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ arian Group . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify and more .
