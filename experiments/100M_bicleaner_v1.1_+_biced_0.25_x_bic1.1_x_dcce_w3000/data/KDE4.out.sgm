<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras page. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated in place of the entire URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not have to make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert texts to translate directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from & konqueror, by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map memory tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setting modules from the kde; addons package. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page which has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module viewing filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Anger filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and then open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: one element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colors and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles may be used (whereby, consequently, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">In the Treemap in & FSView performance algorithms, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. it is drawn as a frame for the nested entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation is left. here it is to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recurrent branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimized area for an entry over the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module image gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the image gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to adjust the number of thumbnails in every line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To view the file name of the image, specify whether the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To display the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="34">Use the comment text box to use a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can set a different color depth to the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the & konqueror; View menu under the navigation pane or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror, and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in the & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are accessing a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the MSIE indicator for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use the own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with base image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. processing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE image plugins (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam; in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. guide to login to the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edited; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply type the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & edited; will also use as Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the uppermost folder containing images as a base folder. & edited; views any subfolder as an album. no image is changed. during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& edited; Durability recursively checks the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this allows you to insert one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change that by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the shell mode of your camera, it may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help menu aid raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderProperties and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivates. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Photo2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & edited; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails from digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitised; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitized;, KPhotos Album, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes are in & digitized; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can store a picture in another part of the albenedim, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment. so the filter on the filename only works if it is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Albency settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albian characteristics or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Imports images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album Importing screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group them under a common name. the collection used by you is used to sort your photos, when you choose Collection from the toolbar or view albums sort by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Eldest, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do so, first tries to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture on the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& edited; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown in this album in the picture window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Select All thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can change about settings digitized. select here the albums page and customize the area preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you allow the mouse cursor to take a moment over a picture, the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that was digitized; goes. albums and keywords allows you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that are with & digitized; you can choose between viewing the pictures, slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing using a photo by right-clicking the F4 image... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... in the editing section, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & edited; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by holding the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digimaster; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail to preview and select turning. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to the trash bin by & kde; Delete F8 image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can do this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My data-list; organizes your photos on the basis of data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days are shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lilies; so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords will be re-imported when the database is lost; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will be the underscore of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by right click and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My key "quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, right click the image and select it in the context menu As album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag it to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also use the right mouse button to preview the images and select from the context menu keywords.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to him. in this way you can select a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the tags menu. the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timately adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Nebraser search box is a small lamp that turns green when the search finds hits. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search hasn't found, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this you will be able to save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results are displayed in My Search List in the main window. the text box Save As is used to change your query to My Search List. if you want to change your selection after the search, just select the corresponding entry from My Search List and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select as advanced search, the dialog box will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. find more information in the section The Tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam, s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are line-by-line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group can be deleted. additionally, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they conform. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar one. by using a sponge the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the matching pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it. move it down while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geodata folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digimaster; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightable from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window will be opened. if you are back in the edited window, you can quickly open the light table with L Tools luminescent table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy is to be seen in which window area. if you want to synchronize preview of the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, they are also executed in the other picture. so you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out of a picture series. if you are using pair mode from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminescent table like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you recognize on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you must click them and hold the & LMB. in the preview mode, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works as well as in other views. simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; click the mouse to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both pictures when you are previewed in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers any part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we look at the download, rename, backup, evaluate, group, backup, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital portfolio management records, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't need to use a certain photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitidied;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the metadata in & digimaster's creation page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. it makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalog pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then it will automatically mount the tree for you or place the images in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam, while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation, because each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to just let you see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you this the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the french Normans 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images to web galleries, then these captions are exported to the label and / or the title of the web gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet before googleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving at speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are already innumerable and will still be deepened in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information. this then displays the photos at the reception site. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author line): links with the author. this field contains the job description of the photographer. examples for this may be titles such as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">The solution for this problem is digital watermark. for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failures, current violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you may not take longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs, but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications reading the corrupted data of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data again to check you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discs remain the longest if you are operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of defect, SMART cannot detect these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also get data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't make a big difference, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. therefore, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy slots and erases the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, please make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shocks that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of just a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery energy when there is a power failure. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. finally, you should remember how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are stored on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more dramatically. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until you should one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one ever seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss of notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to minor damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no one has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not fully saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorating. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't worry about data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year. so, backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget airplane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention will always mean not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite backup is panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, keep associated XMP files, original memory, scalability, media, recovering images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way than to forge a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Now virtualization is available to everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing the size of the system.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and have placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new disk is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resident / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext2, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is made from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation in heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may possibly be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the '90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata PlatformConverter; a blend of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xlsquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP works because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera body, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & edited, then you should add the metadata again. these may be truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; in the Adding a Photos to an Album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicode, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it is trying to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a ready-to-use indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notes, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & edited; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking the button download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods by & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download Selected. the selected button selected is as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new download option is available. these images have not been edited by & edited. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder. the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & edited; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you must select them first and use them to delete the selected delete option.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted; if you want to completely delete the camera finder, you should do this via the camera menu, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names if you upload photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want another date format than the standard format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch to the date & time option for further adjustments. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option Camera File Name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case when downloading. or in capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digitied; used for a photo, will be displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings to rename will be saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digimaster; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, it can be digitized; this is used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case, & edited, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, queries & digikam asks you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position that can be displayed in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode, users who want to locate the place of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitelites and map references. so, the question is actually more about how the data is in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy co-ordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you as much control over his workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & edited. to access these settings, you must select the Settings dialog. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to be previewed or image editing will be set. you set the default behavior of & digikam, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface. also in a database synchronisation these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is synonymous with the author's line: this field should include the photographer's job title. this can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the picture that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digitized; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam, tries, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file has been edited by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the LED, these settings will be switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size loading quot; you should only use on fast hosts. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you are using picture editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing mode, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in colour information. please refer to this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Save lossless JPEG 2000 files. even if you select the lossy option, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference causes a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that is photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as a penetrating white. finally, you can try to resolve some parts of the missing information from the skylights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digkam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">"" "if you select the" "" "Reconstructive" "" "option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adapted individually for each picture." ""</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digitize; image editing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw provides you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color efacts at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction, since it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information as to translate colour information from a color space to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders Folder the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; to store your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you want to use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not correcting conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your picture would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for what is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface can & digikam; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and they are then edited by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally they are 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the trash bin you can adjust the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the deleting a picture and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly navigated through & edited, if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also include the display of the Welcome screen by & digitit; under certain circumstances, this speeds up the start process of & digitidied;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Setting When starting new photos forces & digikam, search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digikam;. if something is deleted from the base folder, & digikam will ask you if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited, to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings from the toolbar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitized, find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edited; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view and improve your photos. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or using the context menu for preview and selecting the entry / Edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The Image Processing includes a series of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to section editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before you have saved the File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you cannot restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or using the button Disconnect image processing restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing or restoring undo by selecting Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should refer to the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB file over the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions between them will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the menu file. if you've made any changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and zoom into the picture in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the list menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically choose the magnifying factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you will be shown in the normal view where you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can view this in the editing dialog by & digikam. you can view it from the edited dialog. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire phrases. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Edit menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digimaster; main window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it will be displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible, which means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC fields so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC marking field in other applications, you should pay attention to these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, either use the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button. with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files, but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords tree and a selection box with the keywords used before.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in the tree by marking the corresponding check boxes. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC-keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to have a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Datum-, keywords and searches. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drop and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to guide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is on K1 keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right key-tree to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created a rule and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have adapted it mainly to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors coming from your camera or scanner will have a predictable departure from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you can make informed choices at any point of the image processing workflow. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are via email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy, why should one use a different color space and thus have to think about ink management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB color space or not, you have to connect your monitor, since sRGB means that your; onitor is on sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you either have to use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before trying any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Compare and Contrast Enhanced from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scrolls the luminosity values over the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or full.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparison: this method adjusts the luminosity coefficient of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundaries and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">If you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in the rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the configuration of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above you see a histogram that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color selected for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save it to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button will reset all filter values to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to consult the Color Management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the color correction menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so you can use it for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"" "the" "" "Key" "" "has four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canine filter." ""</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was developed when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically feasible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original picture is the (1) and this works the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaqua; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers, especially those that shoot hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide reps the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can unload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your adjustments can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce satiety instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the instrument sound correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more concrete the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear imaging is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values as interactively as with the inputs. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically adjusted for all shade, medium and sun tones. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiable Channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a crank to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is to see a red marker. if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons, you can do exactly that. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer in the & digitized; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well as you can also use the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer then is THE tool to create great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color channel. color-brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel look different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the color brewing.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. you can store any blender setting for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is to be seen under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Pane Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good in all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re-development in a Sepiathoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) squamafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digicode; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digimaster; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep your attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly encircles the image with a colored line, Niepce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool According to aspect ratio previously.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this goes even in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digimaster; tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Template Apply in Image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the template, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder to the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the templates files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons below which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use the template on your image. the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digimaster; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process requires colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images have often used a camera internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a focus aid while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the focus on sharpening. you can call this with the menu entry Correction.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should handle this carefully because the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image is refocused. you can refocus it via the menu entry Corrigieren. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to soften the softmark with the menu entry Corrigieren LYCTION and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp Maskieren is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase of the radius or the amount enhance the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from sharper and therefore beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool attempts to create an image & quot; refocus quot; in which it reverses the image. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus mostly reaches better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocus colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixels that are far from original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will add the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Gauß's sharpness: this is the" "" "Gauß" "" "sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is" "" "Gauß" "". "in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the trimming, color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will leave unpleasant artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the blurring. for the Viennese filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimum Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original non-sharp color image that needs to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing knob sets the sharpness of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove any artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smooth and sharp, details should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the focus should always be subordinated to direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be placed higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepping width [0,1, 10]: integral stepping width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it happen.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and have a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts removed. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is an odd black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to ascertain luminance changes. if it is raised, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the filter. this value improves the filter frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls colour tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly romped, but also spells out the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of the phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. when it is lifted, the edges appear smoother when it is too high a smearing occurs. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen a picture. use the tool to soften the softmark with the menu entry Corrigieren LYCTION and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters to restore gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that emerge in digital, original or retrospectively digitalised images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture translation. texture translation is performed with another tool, image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and have a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation using the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grain on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph, which was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scanned illumination and photo paper. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel to remove photos taken with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppress for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and thumbnails will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: an average of neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear turns (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, often cannot light the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettierelquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise unharpening effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure ranges of today's film and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignment correction filter and with three further control of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light refreshment at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitized lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second graph deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of gravity fourth corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth grade. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thereby corrects the first graph. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The spherical or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best, perform this correction as the first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the File Transformation menu or remove the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and picture is to correct the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the sound-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the Gimpanze.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film graining and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Add film granulator if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitized; filter cine is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gradation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular look especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film effect effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; filter oil painting creates the look of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the machining is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage ze. the lines whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose for yourself to sketch out. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen height and the lower knob evaluates the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitized; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digimaster; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equals 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses proprietary proprietary algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look like it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects with the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses proprietary proprietary algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lens: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zoomatic camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpness: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness sharpness: blurred the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color paddling in the picture and blurrings it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation using the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirrors or rotating in the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the Transforming Drees or Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change is using a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many picture editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflate was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be placed higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The membs save as and loads are used exactly. each insertion for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blowing is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation using the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo blowing by magnifying a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard augmentation for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. image editing allows you to create a picture. to trim a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply holding it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Image Processing button in the toolbar and the photo is cut to fit (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or Save file entries under the File menu to save the edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it's always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically centred the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help enable help to fade in so that you can put together your images better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elbows, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid auxiliary lines if you assemble a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The gold spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-country rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow along this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equalateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Options and Vertical mirroring options can be used to reflect the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free press is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it will happen easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digitized; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">Move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transformers trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatically Cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas generated by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas generated by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Turn left corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right top corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Turn left corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Turn right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture gets a bit covered. for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shoring tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single lubrication, this effect is usually negligible, but two loops create twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has jagged triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats that know. this is done on the basis of file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it will change. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; in the Configuration section, you can find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s release can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw picture format, you can read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guidances in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the Configuration section, you can find further information about using modules with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to make photo editing are in & digitized. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, sofas, noise suppression, refocus, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applied quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current picture. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicate. the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected panel.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divide without duplicate. the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties page shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program used for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; programs that include & graphviz; programs that include & graphviz; - programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kvisiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kvisiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph. die & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kvisiviewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI;. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Placards; and & konqueror; (so that a change of graph in & posters; recomputed the graph and in & kgraph viewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & posters; opening or graphs in & kvisiviewer; open in a & posters; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kvisiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraph viewer; without any argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar will only open the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is restricted in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just been modified by a different program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later it will be done. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Settings kgraph viewer; also, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a current & kgviewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you can choose whether you want to open a new & kvisiviewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that comes to a page should be adjusted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Rect Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or leave the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open site gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraph viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the session already running) or determine that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page allows you to specify the start behaviour of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) or decide to be asked every time you start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally with a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; -layoutalgorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz include:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphs. it produces representations according to the spring-spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; -algorithm creates a spring-spring model for uncoated graphs. it uses the fruchtman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circularly according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms change special options, or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungereted graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner powered by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this, you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. choose the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values with reduced drag to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the image. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, otherwise some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button, you must wait until the scan is completed and the window will appear to set the image file options. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160, or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected a screen shot in the Import &gt; Screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box dialog appears with the options already described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to show your photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web site. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you click Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click the Ok button to start uploading the photos to the Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as tags during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can adjust the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option Changes the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above dialog appears. to run a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains natural data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. put your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates a higher deviation for the GPS time and camera direction. if the deviation is below, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data of one place for pictures, you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region concerned and increase sie.Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the scan tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below it will appear the albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images. choose a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Reiter for preview images, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window is not closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mausages. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as no compression of color information takes place. for example, this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please view exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encryption Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Enver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic image output. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV to the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. afterwards, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Enashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is set below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in case of doubt, you should leave them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file in the name of the mpeg output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start generating the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gimbp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: expect from dcraw not to generate the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to process your images frequently or further use them further, you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images via the Add images button. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the image list and place it there to add the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Pictures button, the selected pictures will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures selected by you are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not send too many images at one time. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails to be sent. it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the comments are made in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Image File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted from lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original readifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the pictures in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it using Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the pictures are displayed in random order. so it is not used in the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 ms correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can browse through them, see the picture. as you can see by comparing them with the picture, there are entries in each group, i.e. persons, places and group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser's view changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both people are shown are displayed. through this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view preview images to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the name, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage of allowing you to display symbols with pictures of persons while also showing a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to open the picture view window (described in more detail) and select the picture for the appropriate person in the context menu. in the view window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field of lettering or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here you can see images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the fast entry, screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would like to print out this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed items Preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in preview screen) and the time line always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described, which you can create through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objectives. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created that can be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not have any more images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so he can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First select the root folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE-supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. to allow the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have related all three to base folders or URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created, whose name will be specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kphotoalbum. you can import them into your database. image properties are imported with and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all the pictures in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a double manner. first it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the .kim file will be searched. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can invoke through the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you wish to copy manually to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu File... select, it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of people belonging to the imported file (if you are a domain) while this category is called for your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will review the different steps from (1) Apply the information about your images, about (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you will see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view the viewer's options. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up entire member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medium as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of choices you choose, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. see the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules menu. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which can be accessed via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are used together by several applications together, it may be possible that the modules are tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little have been tested. therefore, you should always try new modules with the demo database first before using this on your own pictures. the demo database can be either accessed via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that share the modules over KIPI are very different, allowing some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: here's an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum will do so, so if you have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the installation dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top of the toolbar. at the moment you don't have a lot of information, because you don't have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by doing so, move the names used up, find the people faster and classify them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon after the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images to your comments. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are placed under the thumbnail on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S.. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry. beware, this requires that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then close the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures if you have not set filters. an example of this is shown here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will be shown in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures from which you wish to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use it with & kphotoalbum; namely, you can use the pictures anywhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can record the view from & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are available for the images 5-9, so you can view the preview of these images. however, you can not view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back into it. if you want to avoid trouble, how to avoid the interlocking of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make accessible to others and click on the latest view lock in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see, and choose the menu entry All out of up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have determined which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will hide all the images you have locked. if you want to see the pictures again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered for unlocking the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to forfeit the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to spend all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered in the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the Infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag and drop them with the mouse. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the appropriate entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; can be moved into full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image. for the zooming, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out the plus button zoomt in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key button sets the zooms, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out zoom out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turn functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this is not working with videos. you can make notes on the current image using the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with characteristics while viewing them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter. in this you see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features placed on your images, these are available in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever selected, then simply bookmark all of the images you want to copy to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you have categories in particular preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after selecting the image. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you can copy & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can revert your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to disable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeling; you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wiremodel views is yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an already selected object, as all subjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">When deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take over these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the object displayed with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render one part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wiremodel view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wiremodel. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window instructions and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under an existing view, drag the cover to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the image to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to order multiple views on top of each other, drag the bassist in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card guides at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from anchoring, drag the drop down to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the front panel.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the front panel. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the View menu, you can find entries for any type of view. new views are floating, you can anchor them anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the View window ordering... Store. there will be a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 topical. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon to render the rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can paste as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"" "if you click on the" "" "render settings" "" "icon in the toolbar or select" "" "View modes" "", "the following dialog will be opened:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can type any name, but make sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section section and enter the picture section to render to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down selector you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user's manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling moves the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive, recursively, because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are computed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 4 pixels will be charged, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and tested for further sub-division. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final option for rendering quality is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry File Importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeling; not yet complete command set of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeling; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. insert the path to your retention and version here. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (e.g. height data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file exists in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wiremodel and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you check high detail faithfulness for extended projections, all the wiremodel views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property provides a better approximation for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a bottom is narrowed down below the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window instructions or create new window instructions. in the window instructions section, it explains how to create and save window instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window instructions. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window setup when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window instructions. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anchoring the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just got & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all the steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything wrong you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window setup:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbars. read the documentation to get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">They will often have to use these menus and icons, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button to a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or enter the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeling; it actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view now also shows the level, even at the moment only as a finite end. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object. you will then see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the Preview button you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment. always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on a fader and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you want to render your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose one colour each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step, as you have already understood the basic principles of work of & kpovmodeling; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button) so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor down one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now offers a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. like on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Erstes Subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection results in some partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers. hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved store are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you do not have any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last-hand command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used do undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the appearance, shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. with this option, you can change default commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the & LMBn; or the Return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether every picture should be displayed in a separate window, or if all the images always want to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1181">You can set up a list of these shortcuts and their function. the global keyboard shortcuts can be set up by right-clicking into the player window and selecting Global Keyboard Shortcuts... selecting the button shortcut in the player window and setting shortcuts... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up any existing multimedia keys to work as & Amarok; short commands work. thus, you make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general features which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function break could & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options from Qt and & kde; additionally Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use kdialog to help the user know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError 53 = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you'll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weists the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now query the new piece with DCOP functions (for example the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths sliding the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu item is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, use dcop Amarok script addcustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed for example, for example storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be loaded with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the configuration of amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. you might just search for a specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you'll find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can you never decide which ones you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you. and if you still find it hard to choose, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is smart, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Because & Amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should have no trouble with compiling. if you encounter any problems, please report it to the mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the configure script for compile time. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Debug Debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up easily via the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">To view the player window, the player window will also turn on or off in addition to the playlist. if the option is off, only the Playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option switches the experimental function of the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Design: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. this changes the color scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Files: this feature is only available when & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External browser: lets choose which browser from & Amarok to start when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists when moving, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok; then enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist on the end of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, the playlist window will pop up / unroll to keep the each running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing to the context browser, switch automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise gray presented section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection of custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback when starting causes & Amarok; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is checked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OSD color for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for selecting colors. if your own colors are not enabled, the preset & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by typing placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate other settings in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. that includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to adjust how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the intersected and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder on changes (for example, if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok; all found playlists in your collections folders (.pls- and .m3u files) will be added to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlists browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered where the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card is the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations concerning the current play if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send playing pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows you & Amarok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve the same performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; get a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedestop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will work hard. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by following in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer using bugs.kde.org and also mount the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable autom. disable when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open when you crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl: "the file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2 tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be re-installed with this command: Perl-MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s icons in the status bar (Random mode / repetition / Dynamic Playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be ignored. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most of the installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or the developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter only one error there if you want to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; just a blank playlist will appear. how do tunes come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start sub-window was converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the evaluation by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the review column must be shown in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column show rating. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this works even if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixers).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (eg. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can not simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts Driver, but instead use GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamers respond to the visualizations. yes, that's a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you will need to register all components. register to register all of the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't work, you can also ask for the IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run in the module folder of GStreamer all the ffmpeg files (you will find the module folder with drag-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. use the mouse to drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it using the Playlist button. you will find this button in the toolbar of the Playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add it to the playlist browser. in addition, when the playlist is in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you can find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select actions audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the playback button.</seg>

<seg id="1330">The burning feature is also available in the playlist. right click on an entry and follow the burning menu. you will have different options for burning a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. besides, some additional packages are listed which make working with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (such as RPM or apt), you will need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter we explain how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The player window also includes a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, larger window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Below the running text display are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the player window. once you check the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist by & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. however, don't be afraid of the abundance of features that are easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be divided into two main sections, the navigation pane is on the left. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information about the current play. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpretation. these three sub-windows are later replaced in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow will be blown away. the information shown there has been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title, you can see the title of the piece, the artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and a MusicBrainz icon next to it. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz-symbol you can find further information about the current piece. you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in the context browser, the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece. the pictures may have any name, but images with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover pictures that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the selected pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section displays the five most rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, the artist's albums, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will pop up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in each area to start playback right away. you can also right-click on it and select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of scripting scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. to do so, no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - Only the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there is another division according to the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / year - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically, and the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / performer - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the collection settings. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box, with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Adds selected pieces of the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry gives you the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will then be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the garbage dump... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition, after which it will appear among different artists.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Uplift composite marking - Changes a new album marked as a composition back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be shown under different artists but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The Playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. there you can enter all the criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used for the connection of & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpret sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the required tracks from the playlist and drop them on the list performer. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, stop & Amarok; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you will find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter / home / mike / musi.tar.gz for example, you can listen to music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert the selected files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist maintains all of the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries into the desired position with the mouse. once you enter letters there, only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one in two, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three are found (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain whitespace, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -a little search for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-clicking in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you can add the Add button to add pieces to the playlist. right next to it, you can save playlists, empty playlist blank and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window using the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example rendition controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting toolbars... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is shown, a slider for the playtime and the playing time of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status bar option in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualization of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can launch them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue a number will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents are shown in the contents view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows selection and dragging of files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work for straightening. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, therefore your taste and style of your task is crucial, which of the included programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & kde; program common, supported & k3b; chiefly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void QValueListlt; DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void rendering Cd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurl (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString parent) void set VolumeID (QString ID)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; choosen for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in wav files on hard drive) and by many encoders that encodes these WAV files (these encoders need to be installed from the Linux distribution). additional encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoder packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to crack the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying the copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (but the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD will be explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already expired file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, Piepsen) for program events (such as read out the & CD; exit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog for & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, to set up the encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences become less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame will still be included with most distributions but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playthings is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually be acceptable to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and auto-stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title String & kaudiocreator have to be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= buttonhole in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs, so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it's important to note that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (meaning of translation: this is the author) bin not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select an address field (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator, to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides an up-to-date list of mirroring servers for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. first, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) are displayed on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). thereby 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; please check the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are still unsure of what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may be found with a search engine, as it is not considered to be completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what is to be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with every read on a & CD; if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is transferred to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if there is more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the / etc / fstab file and an attempt with the device descriptions exist for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. in order to freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server via the Internet. how does the system know what data the CD should get? read the section on freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls reboot the 8880 protocol by default, there may be more luck with protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your host)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this then / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously decoding WAV files: with a dual core or a core or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for every read on a & CD; if you choose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Because we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screen photos look a little different than those for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only when the CD; as audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the section Questions and Answers by Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screenshot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current title' field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current Title' field, unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for each of the comments inidividually per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after a successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see the Help to the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the data anyway. for more information, go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you will return to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BOM list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches on or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the selection selection to start reading the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read directly on the disk. the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. do you have checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, read out and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in the case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is going to be part of the kdemultimedia package today. if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous package from there. most distributions include a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -package is. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is targeted to people who compile source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings. the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still to read? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first time of the program, without any clue as it should continue from this empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? whoever reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you managed to get the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke game of & kde; apart from others, he has also some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts that others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is required for GUS cards. ALSA is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop to drag and drop all MIDI files from a & konqueror; -Window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically detects the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you end & kde; quit while playing a song, kmid will start playing with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this works also with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Play in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu piece or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (in several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events should be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which one song is used, so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke lyrics. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event, select the entries of the text or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in line. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the counterfeit in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. keep in mind when adding a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it will again appear the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically add to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (using Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu collections menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the next song next song, next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song, select the previous piece, the previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter, since it is not stored when it is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translated General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map that converts all events of the change patch to Bright Piano events in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary for each occurrence to have a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to show that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can support in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how the Patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the parity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all KeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gunshot (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, in which each sound represents another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map tones on the percussions channel. take a look at the maps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to replace the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP segment has 16 lines numbered between 0 and 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be defined with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies, in which ratio pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a Pitch-Bender event is sent with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch bender event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to play a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer gives you a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't feel like adding all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before, make sure to enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn on Automatically Add to Collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it inspires me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you want to make me happy, write an email: larvar @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact me under Friends of & kmid; but before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get any money from anybody. I would like to stress that I just keep using programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarvar / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; use the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card besides that you can of course hear no music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the mailing lists or send a error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SMB; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, then you should use the Lasting playlist category.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose playlists from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author's convenience, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; bodyshell; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; / lt; / smilgt; In the package testing / some examples of SMIL are supported by & SMEs; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer;. here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; all must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SPlayer; it can even include the special embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & SMB; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if it was determined), this must be done by typing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, it should play phonon all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the SMB, the dialog is set in the Settings under - &gt; Quele- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be useful for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by SMEs for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrresource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there tips on how to make my CDROM drive more quieter when I play it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is to be run as root after the device is locked. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom switches to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested for performance each time?</seg>

<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI; file [device independent file]], jumps & kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the image search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element is clicked on in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it. the preliminary search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as it was clicked on a section in the & latex; source text, the corresponding point in the DVI; -viewer is sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other included .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is shown on a" "" "in-line" "" "range, and there is no call to" "" "call" "" "by" "" "Quick" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, you should see the three large selection fields. the selection fields have been developed for quick inclusion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is available for quick inclusion of the document in parts, chapters, sections...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box For further information, please refer to articles such as keywords, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, a picture or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (choose a drop-down selector).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation marks a selection list with a literary index. at & bibtex; it works only if the file belongs to a project. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; files can also be written in & kicks; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ lise is used for determining the font size. it can be used to specify the font size for the main text, the notes notes, etc. there are the following letters to be used:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two options available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has to be entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the volume building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically removes the file.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If it fails to compile the document, it should be searched for errors. if it is not the case, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. if, for example, a report with the font number 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the creation of the font inside the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are made only within the environment (by\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there are no restrictions (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands either end with the\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {posth}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ 'emph} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language is displayed, now follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & box;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for better readability of the document should be done. for this purpose, a quote, a few passages in the fat and italics pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing (in viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. as soon as the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source text, the conversion can begin in other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preferred search permits the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; just setup modern under Settings box... Tools Buildings are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the advance search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on to advance search. the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI; the viewer is then executed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this feature in & ocepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using the & DVI; viewer, there may be an error. if there is an error, it will be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file reports the source code in the source code. in the editor, the buttons Previous LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error can be used for jumps between errors. the logging file always indicates the line in which the error appears. to view the incorrect line, it must be clicked on the error in the log and & Kile; jump to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be re-written from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting a file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated setup of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& posters; used & posters; as internal editor. & posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>

<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex; -instructions from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizard may trigger additional jump marks. this is a special type of bookmarks within the text. the Menue Editing Marks or the corresponding keyboard shortcuts enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this also emphasizes the jump mark, so that it is automatically translated when entering a mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & Posts; already offers outstanding opportunities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source always supported many environments and groups, and therefore supported & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit selecting are the following commands to choose the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">It includes a complete paragraph (group of lines included on both sides an empty line). with a paragraph does not mean a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an advanced meaning as this command also has an extended meaning, as this command will end with a backslash (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be balanced first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Placards; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit removal, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit selecting paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under Editing environment for a more convenient work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command terminates the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX Group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded close bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the softer bracket of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many shaded groups braces can quickly get lost over. this command closes the recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & html files are deleted every time you run meinproc.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, everyone who has worked on the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook then simply let the current working folder be selected. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, have to do with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system is very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the desired in & quantaplus. the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we start editing the Edit menu with the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; -Element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarchical relationship to one another. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have multiple roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze Scheme. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Apart from an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that sets a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">The event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An e-mail is sent to the addressee selected in the receiver list. the addressees can be a team or sub-project manager. see if such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To add comments is simple. you can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (Role), with the nickname of the nickname of the team member, play a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader After the field and sub-project managers, the respective area or subproject names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and Roles names are independent of bumpy caps, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only over & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog comprises some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: large / Sumpy of tags: big / Sumpy of automatically inserted tags. normal case-sensitive means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Sumpy of attributes: large / lower case-sensitive of automatically inserted attributes. normal case-sensitive means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags include: when checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, it will be inserted immediately after the tag.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish tag: when turned on, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the Standard button, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening-opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; generates regular backup copies so that in case of a power outage or crash when the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a map guide), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is passed through by modifying the MDI modes and docking / dependency of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves the control of the possibility of displaying warnings by hooks of no more queries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse-click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are grouped in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. abbreviations are grouped into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP's. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifwercase abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third parties, which can be re-used by any KPart-enabled application, at the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading Component in "Only-Read" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Read-KParts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus. if the information entered is correct, then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redesigned. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations of plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available to support the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">One view, in which all hold points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) is displayed in the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it divides the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, that uses a debugger, so you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to send a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without adding information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a requirement is given, the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, and if possible, it will be corrected in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front-end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust to your needs and how you & quantaplus can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for markup and script languages as well as & CSS. they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag files are handy, symbolic lists of image buttons (above the editing window) that insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see also for details of the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day shows. the descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but only element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute, etc; This is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to reach the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that summarizes the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a merely element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; be replaced. this will not cause any leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; -Window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "function" returnType = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, can be edited via DTD Edit DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple descriptionrc; with the following entries are created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... created. click New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned key shortcut. by clicking the Custom button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keine the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can start external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; Even are the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus uses: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced by PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus, only one instance is executed, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus. in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input the output of the executed application can be rerouted. there are two types output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, to the default output output. it can be specified, what is to be done with the text written on the default output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use, enable dialogue" "" "Edit Day" "" "when available so that an input is possible when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graph more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; use 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user be signaled that clicking on this icon will insert; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, whichever is, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar or it should be shared by several dividers into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog on Settings Toolbar. ensure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by half of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up to the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be implanted in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their toolbar (s) to load their toolbar (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like best. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = func.html Sec2.2 = func.html func1 = day 1.html tag2 = tag2html tag = tag 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Introduction = Importtion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation should be displayed directly for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the Context List (ContextList) and the file lines list.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context items that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you won't get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the lost resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or else. in different places, there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all others & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and useable for publication. to make an airport contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the source of resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can choose one. enter the input fields in the dialog New resource (URL preview can be empty) and clicking OK will start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, uploaded to the toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the Author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tagXML format. there's the easiest way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from DTD's DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to use. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitioner: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to be able to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who is & quantaplus, available. from toolbars over actions everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this enables the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emofies the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and toolbars. please check in, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can right-click the file-bar to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all file-tracker, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS instructions to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with file managers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be carried out with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. using the right mouse button, more functions are available, such as running the script, editing, or sending mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refresing the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can change attributes and namespaces quickly with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; by the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached, edited and viewed for project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two box riders at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This guide displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This guide shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; transmits the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive by & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save and load it in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus, for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why Developing what someone else has developed? thanks to & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly converted to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details can be found with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; run or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are a special characters to the & HTML; -spelling so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and whitespace in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift + Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if you & PHP; -script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loading a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set using Settings... added. toolbars are saved using toolbars toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP file should be freshened without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using toolbars is denied if that day in this location contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on them. clicking on an activated plugins will deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes is based on derail; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; by external use tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instantaneously switching between different types of interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the presentation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the corresponding sub-window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; - web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add which ones and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering text file, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension weprj (e.g. foo.webprj).</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web contents you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the project's main folder, let it be attached. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option allows you to view all files and folders within the main folder, and you can make an exact selection according to your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the hook, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new Project Assistant provides three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded from the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or with Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in addition, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles section, you can set high loading profiles (see in) as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by saying one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be enabled and these actions can be added, altered or deleted. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus is closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are just as well, but the entries are opened and opened with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password saved on the disk -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best stamped by the toolbar menu. use and Add split. adding toolbars is treated below in adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols on this can be set either by using a context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated in the dialog where it can be indicated which actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and setting settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates in principle like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions that one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select file as template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File as template save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and dragging on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template, enter a name for the template, and secure it. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headlines and footers, or dynamically connect to & PHP, create files, or link them to them. in addition, you can keep track of some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates stored files. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify a folder's behavior, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden as soon as elteral attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template summary. if a regular folder is set up, it would disable templates in this path in principle, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to create or recreate text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers through copying contents templates into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) through a full command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source editor available via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second splits the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source editor if necessary, in which the performed changes in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document containing & PHP, a small green icon displays the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. PHP is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes both in the source editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor runs in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, the keystroke activates the active cursor from a window to the other, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization spacing between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. when selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this is possible to edit invisible tags at work with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS styling template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is as usual in a word processor, because of moving with the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or removal key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that the insertion of tags already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other drop anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables wizard or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are shown visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialogue enables manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...), or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog opens up your selection and displays them again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge is enabled, the target field is active and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then begins immediately. in open dialogue, you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd have to create two appropriate files, upload them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything & kdiff3; only drop the dropping of text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees in the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in rare exceptions.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summation column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [gealters] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then be the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or manually editing, no more row remains in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps then again select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the sharing window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-image down) or to the next / last unresolved conflict. therefore, differences between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if it is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. be careful with this option however you might accidentally override the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line ending of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore it to the next start (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are shown in italics. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered toasted. on these systems, the preset button automatically introduces an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. even when merging, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others in turn save only a line feed character, although they are different. if this option is checked, the carriage return marks are made visible, but like a white mark. while merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you have to & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is enabled, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Through the selection fields for the encoding, a brief reference appears, which is the local encoding. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress premature changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color coded overview column are displayed. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">It can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file into the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name. (if this function is used to restart the merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass it to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal word processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command will only be used for line comparison. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be maintained for display and merge. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you are using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge all folders recursively with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; Folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merge. to start merging, select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folders is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that has been found during scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions and all subdirectories can be opened up with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then, folders have the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are active. then Selects & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the option new file instead of merging (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to be copied. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors cannot be eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be processed by the other. status column shows Fertig if the merge succeeds, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the three-folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merge, B is chosen as the target and when syncing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder are also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (key shortcut) to merge only the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merging actions by conflicting file types, a message indicating the faulty parts appears. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all the entries, a dialog window appears with the options Using, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge-window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, an appropriate dialog will appear. then execute & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you can see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (at the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge function has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern will be shown in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the pattern with a semicolon. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be shown in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is enabled, the links will be treated as normal folder and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage is a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the files are selected to merge in a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file will be suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and obtains the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible while merging certain files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option Directory & Text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between folder and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start folder merge. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be set to Erlebaud and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative undone or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or change date. therefore, the permissions or the change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is at present as a variation observer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3 Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; suppose the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports the comparison of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by checking in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all the programmers who have gone this way or that they will go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc).</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly, no src is left; no src is left, and the text cannot be quenched. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the root folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should have no problems compiling. if you encounter difficulties, please report on the mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insertion) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to reread the update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries that show differences. this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & pager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; when clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager. if, however, on an application within & pager; clicking on it also appears the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On desktop and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in the & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is ticked together with name, the names will be labeled with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop also appears as background in the & pager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & pager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems only.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the layout of the & Kpager; main window can be defined: classically lets & pager; in a 2xN grid appears, as known from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for viewing on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as icons or with their contents and move it outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & pager; and then set up selector switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can't be changed in the Settings dialog. you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen loupe. you can enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: these include artists, web designers and people with a visual disability. this documentation should be a complete manual for using & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & Klikes; launch, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kfavor; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can display a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the environment of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting of the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse cursor is not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that occurs while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear even if & kmousetool; avoid pain when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is easy: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move activates, power & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can pull the pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligently shifting is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the mouse button is waiting, before releasing the mouse button, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at the moment. in GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already press the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be disabled first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of the position of a mouse-click without any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckling you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard hub. it can cause accidentally moving the mouse clicks without unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the front rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to select text to copy it into the clipboard and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but it will probably cause them some trouble. here are some advices:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; use text instead as follows: execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when you move the move time when it is smart move. later, you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click, but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you need to install the XTest-extension for & X-Window; this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and cause pain to antigen.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, voice speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of voice and pitch. SSML is part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the speed or sound settings in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and set limit detection filter (SDB filter). SBDs split text into individual phrases. this can & ktts; faster with prereading starts, because only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit detection filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit detecting filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more set-level detection filter, but beginners will get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to select the speaker selection by selecting. switch off the speaker selection and select text to read. switch on the speaker selection, change some features and check how the speaker selection changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel texts on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">String recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab tags are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (knot), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>

<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top one on the card interface speaker). in other words: no spokespersons are defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field speaker, which is most likely to clear the following, click on the standard speaker selection button and then use speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktts; has been terminated. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by using GStreamer 0.8.x, you may need a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the console; appears a message saying: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find clues to possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but ktmugrgram doesn't display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttd / festivalint / bind / apps / kttd / festivalint. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizeroes such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for speakers. depending on the chosen voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the voice speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; prereading. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reformerfilter, and set the speaking speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file renames the GENDER-tags to convert from SSML to Saber-tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a character string replacement filter and now I can go in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the map fronter orders will be shown, the order consists of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter interpunctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). use a filter for propositional detection instead.</seg>

<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts. (HTTP: / / stream.freedesst.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">With July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read even more.</seg>

<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphones. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the GNU / Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on your distribution's CDs.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the option code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & knetworkconf, which allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a standardized, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -Package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be already functioning and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and releasestand. by marking the setting non-re-questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options gray are displayed, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, by clicking on the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the whole functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab on the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... in the dialog device can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the drop-down list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask, the subnet mask must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the host console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch on an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. deactivating an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the machine in the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will release this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the name resolution calculator allows for a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be grouped by selection of entries and additions or grading in the list with the knobs Hinauf or Herder in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking on the Add... button from the group machine to name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name known machine describes machine name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains names known by name, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP still in the test is to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Objects machine will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & konos; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; additionally, the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second one will discuss all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is imparted.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large spread. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future, so this description is currently being focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is assignable. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be arbitrarily selected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.045; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is accidentally converted by the scripts in SuSE. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it provides the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar that provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective extraction. the second goal was to answer a question my wife posed: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spool the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. don't know & kdat; don't know the pre-tensioning on the tape, you'll be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preview, it searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. sets your tape drive before you can format it before being used. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity & kdat; with the tape formatting continues. all data on the tape are lost thereby! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog will open for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check process has been started, the dialog appears for check. in this dialog, you can review your selection once more and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reconnect the restore, the files to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the restore menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can review your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, dialog returns. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup file:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up, which are stored on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the other files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before tar calling. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command will load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it is automatically discarded when releasing & kdat; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option from floppy creators.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, & kdat; the hardport block size for the tape drive to be changed. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a log viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system is storing the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems appearing on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup tries & ksystemlog; first of all, the system log - to open the system log. if this is not shown, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not having system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criteria or after entered strings. enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the process name and log in the filter bar to show the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as the protocol lines of the stage hint. the color display of protocol rows can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example, in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the Process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new record lines that are added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log on the menu in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find more recent information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of program starts at boot-up of the system in the & Linux world. that's because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V init without a new installation and reformat. the Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when you boot the system or change to another runtime. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things like setserial, which is started only once.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the init in different places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial section:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can change / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you will be able to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between levels or move the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry will be removed from its original runtime (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new range. in order to copy them to a new round level, you need to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The item number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runtime, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runtime with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorter number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter button to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts to restart constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made changes, you need to save it. either you use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two map-cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users will create a map on which you can set individual settings. other flashcards appear if Shadow Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card box appears if Shadow Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable to the file quota user / quota group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primarian Group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boat manager, add the boot password, remove and change the time to boot the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify and more.</seg>
